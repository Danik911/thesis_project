# URS-028: Personalized Medicine Orchestration Platform
**GAMP Category**: Ambiguous (4/5)
**System Type**: Configured workflow engine with optional custom algorithm modules
**Domain**: Precision Medicine / Cell & Gene Therapy
**Complexity Level**: High

## 1. Introduction
Implement a platform to orchestrate personalized therapy workflows (apheresis, manufacturing slotting, logistics, chain-of-identity/chain-of-custody) primarily using vendor configuration of workflows and rules. For advanced matching and risk scoring, optional custom-developed algorithm modules may be added.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- URS-028-001: Configure end-to-end workflow templates for apheresis, manufacturing, QC release, and infusion.
- URS-028-002: Enforce chain-of-identity and chain-of-custody with dual-scanning verification.
- URS-028-003: Implement scheduling and slot allocation with configurable constraints.
- URS-028-004: Provide exception handling workflows for temperature excursions and delays.
- URS-028-005: Support configurable risk scoring rules using vendor scripting.
- URS-028-006: Allow optional custom-developed modules for patient-to-lot matching optimization.
- URS-028-007: Provide dashboards for vein-to-vein time and release KPIs.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-028-008: Full audit trail for all handoffs and custody events.
- URS-028-009: 21 CFR Part 11 e-signatures for critical actions.
- URS-028-010: Compliance with GDP for logistics and cold-chain records.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-028-011: Orchestrate 1,000 concurrent patient journeys.
- URS-028-012: Event processing latency < 1 second under normal load.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-028-013: Integrate with EHR, LIMS, MES, courier systems via standard APIs.
- URS-028-014: SSO with OIDC and device identity for scanners.

## 6. Technical Architecture Requirements (for custom modules)
- URS-028-015: Custom algorithm modules shall be containerized and versioned.
- URS-028-016: Provide explainability artifacts for algorithm decisions.
