- **URS-EMS-002**: Temperature readings shall be recorded at intervals not exceeding 5 minutes.
- **URS-EMS-003**: The system shall use vendor-supplied software without modification.
- **URS-EMS-004**: Temperature range: -80°C to +50°C with accuracy of ±0.5°C.
- **URS-EMS-005**: The system shall generate alerts when temperature deviates ±2°C from setpoint.
- **URS-EMS-006**: All data shall be stored in the vendor's standard database format.
- **URS-EMS-007**: Standard reports provided by vendor shall be used for batch release.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- **URS-EMS-008**: System shall maintain an audit trail per 21 CFR Part 11.
- **URS-EMS-009**: Electronic signatures shall use vendor's built-in functionality.
- **URS-EMS-010**: Data shall be retained for 7 years using vendor's archival feature.

## 4. Performance Requirements
