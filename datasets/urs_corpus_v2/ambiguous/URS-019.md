# URS-019: Clinical eTMF Index Harmonization
**GAMP Category**: Ambiguous (4/5)
**System Type**: eTMF indexing service with configurable rules and optional custom plugins
**Domain**: Clinical Operations
**Complexity Level**: High

## 1. Introduction
The eTMF Index Harmonization service standardizes Trial Master File (TMF) document indexing across studies. The solution may be implemented with vendor configuration for mapping to TMF Reference Model v3.3, or via custom-developed plugins for complex sponsor-specific taxonomies and automated classification.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- URS-019-001: Configure mappings between source systems and TMF Reference Model artifacts.
- URS-019-002: Support rule-based document classification using vendor's scripting.
- URS-019-003: Allow custom-developed classification plugins for edge-case documents.
- URS-019-004: Provide duplicate detection and resolution workflow.
- URS-019-005: Enforce controlled vocabularies for study, site, and artifact metadata.
- URS-019-006: Provide validation queue with human-in-the-loop review.
- URS-019-007: Maintain traceability from source entry to final TMF artifact.
- URS-019-008: Provide configurable dashboards for completeness KPIs.
- URS-019-009: Support batch reprocessing with versioned rulesets.
- URS-019-010: Provide exception handling with CAPA linkage.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-019-011: Maintain ALCOA+ integrity for all document metadata transformations.
- URS-019-012: Enforce 21 CFR Part 11-compliant electronic signatures for approvals.
- URS-019-013: Retain audit trails for indexing, reclassification, and deletions.
- URS-019-014: Provide role-based authorization with least-privilege defaults.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-019-015: Process 10,000 documents/hour with standard rule sets.
- URS-019-016: Classification latency < 2 seconds for single documents.
- URS-019-017: Dashboard load time < 5 seconds with 1M records.
- URS-019-018: Availability â‰¥ 99.9%.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-019-019: Connectors for eTMF, CTMS, and EDC systems using standard APIs.
- URS-019-020: Pluggable plugin SDK for custom classification modules.
- URS-019-021: Integration with enterprise identity provider (SAML/OIDC).
- URS-019-022: Export to regulatory submission packages (eCTD-ready).
