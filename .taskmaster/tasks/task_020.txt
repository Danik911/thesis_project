# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Consolidate and validate datasets for analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Aggregate all collected raw data (system performance metrics, cost data, compliance audit results, security testing outputs, human-AI collaboration logs, manual vs automated benchmarks) into a single analysis workspace and perform data cleaning and validation.
### Details:
- Create a centralized repository (e.g., project/data) with subfolders per domain: performance, cost, compliance, security, collaboration, benchmarks.
- Define a data schema for each dataset (variables, units, expected ranges, missing value codes). Implement schema checks using a data validation tool (e.g., Great Expectations) to ensure type consistency, ranges, and uniqueness.
- Normalize time units, currency, and IDs across datasets; join keys should include experiment_id, fold_id (for cross-validation), date_time, and system_version.
- Handle missing data via predefined rules: listwise deletion for critical metrics, mean/median imputation for ancillary metrics, and document all imputations in a data_changes.log.
- Create a data dictionary capturing variable definitions, derivations (e.g., ROI = (baseline_cost - system_cost)/baseline_cost), and calculation sources.
- Snapshot the cleaned datasets as versioned artifacts for reproducibility.

## 2. Perform statistical analyses and cost-effectiveness computations [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Execute all required statistical tests and calculations: significance testing (p<0.05), confidence intervals, cross-validation variance, ROI and cost-benefit, and produce analysis-ready summary tables.
### Details:
- Implement scripts (Python/R) with a reproducible pipeline (e.g., Python: pandas, scipy, statsmodels; R: tidyverse, broom) and seed control.
- Statistical significance: choose tests per metric type (t-test/Welch for means, Mann-Whitney if non-normal, paired tests where design applies). Report test statistic, df, p-value, effect size (Cohen's d/Cliff's delta) and 95% CI.
- Confidence intervals: compute 95% CIs for primary metrics (accuracy, latency, throughput, cost) using parametric or bootstrap (BCa, 10k resamples) when assumptions fail.
- Cross-validation analysis: compute per-fold means, variances, and overall mean ± SD; assess variance components and stability; include learning curves if available.
- ROI/cost-benefit: quantify baseline vs system costs, compute ROI, payback period, and sensitivity analysis over key parameters (labor rate ±20%, volume ±20%). Highlight observed 91% cost reduction and 6-minute generation time; document calculation steps and assumptions.
- Produce tidy summary tables (CSV/Parquet) for each section with metadata and units; store under analysis/outputs.

## 3. Create publication-quality visualizations and appendix materials [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Generate all charts, plots, and matrices to support Chapter 4, with consistent styling, captions, alt-text, and export assets for inclusion.
### Details:
- Define a visual style guide (fonts, colors, axis formats) and apply globally.
- Visuals to produce: performance bar/violin plots with CIs; ROC/PR curves; cross-validation boxplots and variance heatmaps; time-to-generate distributions (highlight 6-minute median/mean); cost waterfall and tornado charts for sensitivity; compliance coverage matrices (GAMP-5, 21 CFR Part 11, ALCOA+); OWASP findings bar chart with severity; manual vs automated benchmark comparison; human-AI calibration reliability diagram.
- For each figure: create a numbered caption, short interpretive takeaway, and alt-text; save as SVG/PNG at 300 DPI and provide data sources.
- Create tables: statistical results table (p-values, CIs, effect sizes), ROI summary, compliance checklist mapping, security findings and mitigations, benchmark comparisons, achievements summary (91% cost reduction, 30 tests generated, 6-minute generation time).
- Package a figures/ and tables/ directory with a manifest mapping to chapter sections.

## 4. Draft Chapter 4: Results and Analysis (sections 1–7) [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Write Sections 1–7 of Chapter 4 using analysis outputs and visuals: Introduction; System Implementation Results; Efficiency Analysis; Compliance Validation; Security Assessment; Human-AI Collaboration; Comparative Analysis.
### Details:
- Use a structured template with consistent headings, cross-references to figures/tables, and formal academic tone.
- Section 1 (2 pages): restate research questions/hypotheses; brief methods reminder; chapter roadmap.
- Section 2 (8 pages): architecture summary, performance metrics with CIs and significance; operational costs; include key achievement callouts (91% cost reduction; 6-minute generation time) and supporting figures/tables.
- Section 3 (10 pages): cross-validation methodology, fold-wise results, variance analysis, time metrics; reliability and stability interpretation; include learning curves and distribution plots.
- Section 4 (8 pages): map results to GAMP-5, 21 CFR Part 11, ALCOA+ controls; present compliance matrices and evidence; note any gaps and remediation.
- Section 5 (6 pages): summarize OWASP testing results, severity, and implemented mitigations; include residual risk discussion and future work.
- Section 6 (6 pages): human-AI collaboration workflows, confidence calibration outcomes, oversight mechanisms; reliability diagrams and calibration error metrics.
- Section 7 (4 pages): manual vs automated benchmarks, significance/effect sizes, productivity impacts; include table and comparative plots.
- Ensure all claims trace to analysis artifacts; embed achievements and exact figures from tables.

## 5. Write Discussion section (Section 8) and finalize Chapter 4 package [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.4
### Description: Complete Section 8: Discussion, integrate limitations and interpretation, finalize the full 50-page chapter with references to achievements, and prepare submission-ready assets.
### Details:
- Section 8 (6 pages): interpret key findings relative to research questions; discuss implications, limitations (data quality, external validity, threats to validity), and practical significance; align with compliance and security contexts; highlight achievements (91% cost reduction, 30 tests generated, 6-minute generation time) with caveats.
- Add transitions and cross-references across sections; ensure numbering and captions match the manifest.
- Compile the chapter with figure/table placement rules; ensure total length ≈50 pages (±10%).
- Create an appendix for extended results and any secondary analyses; include methods for sensitivity and robustness.
- Final QA: consistency of terms, acronym list, and adherence to institutional formatting.
- Export PDF/Word with embedded fonts and include figures/, tables/, analysis/outputs as supplementary materials.
