# Task ID: 30
# Title: Execute First Fold Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Run fold 1 of k=5 cross-validation with complete metrics collection and validation mode enabled. This includes real API execution, security validation, and unified workflow execution for all fold 1 documents, with observability and trace capture. Execution is currently blocked at the LLM wrapper compatibility step.
# Details:
First fold execution progress:
- Validation mode configured via environment variables (VALIDATION_MODE, VALIDATION_MODE_EXPLICIT)
- DeepSeek V3 successfully initialized via OpenRouter
- Phoenix observability enabled with real trace capture (e.g., all_spans_20250813_220932.jsonl)
- All 4 fold 1 documents processed through security validation with real threat analysis
- Unified workflow execution started for each document, progressing through multiple steps with real API calls
- Consultation bypass threshold set and logging verified (BYPASS_CONSULTATION_THRESHOLD=0.7)
- Execution reached categorization step before encountering SecureLLMWrapper incompatibility with LlamaIndex FunctionAgent ("Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of LLM")
- System architecture and validation mode confirmed as sound up to this point

Current status: 80% complete. Blocked on SecureLLMWrapper adjustment for LlamaIndex compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify environment variables for validation mode are set and effective (VALIDATION_MODE, VALIDATION_MODE_EXPLICIT, BYPASS_CONSULTATION_THRESHOLD).
2. Confirm DeepSeek V3 model is initialized and connected via OpenRouter.
3. Ensure Phoenix observability is active and real traces are captured for all workflow steps.
4. Validate that all 4 fold 1 documents are processed through security validation with threat analysis.
5. Check that unified workflow execution starts and progresses for each document, with real API calls and step transitions.
6. Confirm consultation bypass logging is active and threshold is enforced.
7. Attempt to progress through categorization step; document and diagnose any blocking issues (e.g., SecureLLMWrapper incompatibility with LlamaIndex FunctionAgent).
8. Upon resolving the blocking issue, re-run the workflow to completion and verify all metrics and data quality checks.

# Subtasks:
## 30-1. Fix SecureLLMWrapper for LlamaIndex FunctionAgent compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and resolve the incompatibility between SecureLLMWrapper and LlamaIndex FunctionAgent ("Input should be a valid dictionary or instance of LLM"). Adjust the wrapper or integration as needed to allow workflow execution to proceed through the categorization step.
