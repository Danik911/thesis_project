# Task ID: 32
# Title: Run Dual-Mode Comparison
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high

- Run with validation_mode=False (production behavior)
- Run same subset with validation_mode=True
- Calculate quality impact metrics
- Document consultation patterns

This provides evidence of validation mode impact for thesis transparency.
