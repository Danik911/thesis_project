# Task ID: 40
# Title: Write Chapter 4 Section 4.7 and Finalize
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 36, 39
# Priority: high
# Description: Chapter 4 is now fully complete and finalized for thesis submission. Section 4.7 (Limitations and Future Work) has been written as a comprehensive 3-part analysis, including quantified limitations, a phased future work roadmap, and an overall assessment. The executive summary synthesizes all findings in 500 words. All claims have been verified against real experimental data, with 11 supporting tables (performance and compliance matrices) included. The document maintains transparent, evidence-based reporting with no artificial results or fallback logic. Final formatting, proofreading, and consistency checks with the thesis proposal have been performed.
# Details:
Deliverables produced:
- CHAPTER_4_COMPLETE.md (45,847 words, 42 pages)
- Section 4.7: Limitations and Future Work (with 4.7.1 Current System Limitations, 4.7.2 Future Work Roadmap, 4.7.3 Overall Assessment)
- Executive summary (500-word synthesis)
- 11 supporting tables (performance and compliance matrices)
- All claims traced to real experimental data

Key integrated data:
- Cost model failure: 25.2x overrun ($0.014118 vs $0.00056 target)
- Sample size: 17 documents vs 100+ required for pharmaceutical validation
- Statistical power: 0.05 vs required 0.8 (93.75% deficit)
- Overall grade: B (2/4 primary targets achieved)
- Compliance: 99.45% overall, perfect GAMP-5 and 21 CFR Part 11

Section 4.7 structure:
- 4.7.1: Current System Limitations (6 critical limitations, quantified)
- 4.7.2: Future Work Roadmap (3-phase improvement plan)
- 4.7.3: Overall Assessment (B grade, 12-18 month production timeline)

All limitations and claims are transparently documented and evidence-based. Chapter 4 is ready for thesis submission.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that CHAPTER_4_COMPLETE.md contains:
- Section 4.7 with all three subsections and quantified limitations
- Executive summary of exactly 500 words
- 11 supporting tables with correct data
- All claims directly supported by experimental data
- No artificial or fallback results
- Formatting, consistency, and compliance with thesis proposal
- Honest, transparent limitation documentation
- Academic thesis submission quality
