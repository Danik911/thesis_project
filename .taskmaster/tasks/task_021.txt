# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Validation Mode for Category 5 Documents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Add validation mode to bypass human consultation for testing while preserving audit trail. This fixes the 33.3% success rate issue by allowing Category 5 documents to proceed with low confidence during validation testing.
# Details:
The system currently triggers consultation_required for Category 5 documents when confidence is low (correct behavior for production). For thesis validation, we need a validation_mode flag that:
1. Logs consultation events that would have triggered
2. Proceeds with low confidence results
3. Tracks these as consultation_bypassed for metrics
4. Preserves production behavior when validation_mode=False
This maintains the NO FALLBACK principle in production while enabling automated testing.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Add validation_mode configuration parameter to unified_workflow.py [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the workflow configuration to include a validation_mode boolean flag and bypass_consultation_threshold parameter
### Details:


## 2. Implement consultation bypass logic in human_consultation.py [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add logic to check validation_mode and bypass consultation while logging the event for audit trail
### Details:


## 3. Create consultation_bypassed event tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement event type and metrics collection for bypassed consultations to track validation mode impact
### Details:


## 4. Test Category 5 document processing with validation mode [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify Category 5 documents complete processing successfully when validation_mode=True
### Details:


## 5. Document validation mode impact on quality metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and document the quality difference between bypassed vs consulted decisions for thesis transparency
