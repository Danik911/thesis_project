# Task ID: 22
# Title: Achieve 100% Audit Trail Coverage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive audit logging for 21 CFR Part 11 compliance. Current coverage is only 40.8% - need to add agent decisions, data transformations, and state transitions.
# Details:
Current audit trail gaps:
- Missing agent decision rationales
- Missing data transformation logs  
- Missing state transition tracking
- Missing error recovery attempts
Must implement cryptographic signatures (Ed25519) for tamper-evident logging and achieve 100% coverage for regulatory compliance.
