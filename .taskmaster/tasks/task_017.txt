# Task ID: 17
# Title: Week 2: Execute Cross-Validation Testing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Run 5-fold cross-validation across 15 URS documents to measure system performance and consistency
# Details:
Execute comprehensive testing protocol:
- Implement k-fold cross-validation (k=5)
- Measure time to generate for each URS (target: 70% reduction)
- Track token consumption and costs
- Calculate requirements coverage (target: ≥90%)
- Measure false positive/negative rates (target: <5%)
- Document variance across runs (target: <5%)
- Perform statistical significance testing (p<0.05)

Collect all performance metrics and generate test suites for analysis.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up 5-fold partitioning over 15 URS documents [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a deterministic 5-fold split of the 15 URS documents, ensuring each document appears exactly once in a validation fold and four times in training folds. Persist the split for reproducibility.
### Details:
- Enumerate URS documents (IDs 1–15) and shuffle with a fixed random seed.
- Partition into 5 folds of size 3 each; store as a JSON manifest listing train/validation document IDs per fold.
- Ensure no data leakage by limiting any preprocessing or artifact generation for a fold to its training subset only.
- Provide a fold iterator that yields (train_ids, val_ids) for k=5.

Add note: Cross-validation module scaffold and FoldManager are implemented and validated.

- Components in place: cross_validation package with fold_manager.py (deterministic 5-fold from JSON), metrics_collector.py (timing/token/cost tracking), cross_validation_workflow.py (LlamaIndex integration), execution_harness.py (entry point), utils.py (analysis helpers).
- Verified against datasets/cross_validation/fold_assignments.json: 5 folds cover 17 URS docs; typical folds use 14 train / 3 val, with fold_5 using 12 train / 5 val; validation integrity ensured (each doc appears exactly once in validation); no data leakage detected.
- FoldManager provides iterator yielding (fold_id, train_docs, val_docs) and maintains audit trails for GAMP-5 compliance.
- Integrated smoke tests pass: FoldManager iteration, MetricsCollector aggregation, CrossValidationWorkflow initialization, and compatibility with UnifiedTestGenerationWorkflow.

Proceed to implement the execution harness (Subtask 17.2) using these components.

## 2. Implement cross-validation execution harness [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Build a runner that iterates over the 5 folds, executes the system on training and validation sets per fold, and captures run-level artifacts.
### Details:
- Define interfaces: prepare_training(train_ids), evaluate_on_validation(val_ids).
- For each fold: train or warm-start the system using only training URS; then run generation/evaluation on validation URS.
- Wrap each URS processing in timing and token metering hooks; aggregate per-fold and per-URS results.
- Emit structured logs (JSONL) per URS and a fold summary with raw predictions, labels, and metadata.
- Include run IDs, fold index, seed, model/version, and config snapshot for reproducibility.
<info added on 2025-08-11T18:44:22.691Z>
Status update: Cross-validation execution harness implemented and validated. Added LlamaIndex Workflow-based CrossValidationWorkflow and ExecutionHarness with event-driven processing. Implemented prepare_training(train_ids) via FoldManager (cached training doc loads) and evaluate_on_validation(val_ids) via UnifiedTestGenerationWorkflow with parallel validation processing. Wrapped each URS with timing and token metering hooks; aggregated per-URS and per-fold metrics via MetricsCollector, including DeepSeek V3 pricing ($0.27/$1.10 per 1M tokens). Established structured JSONL logging with Pydantic validation: per-URS logs include run_id, fold_id, document_id, success, processing_time, raw_predictions, labels, token_usage, costs; fold summaries include success_rates, performance_metrics, category_distribution, error_analysis. Outputs: {experiment_id}_urs_processing.jsonl and {experiment_id}_fold_summaries.jsonl with run metadata (run_id, fold_index, seed=42, model="deepseek/deepseek-chat", config_snapshot). Dry-run verified: 5 folds over 17 docs loaded; components initialize; logging paths emitted; integration with UnifiedTestGenerationWorkflow confirmed. Ready for full cross-validation execution and subsequent performance analysis.

## 3. Instrument performance metrics: time, tokens, cost [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Integrate precise measurement of generation latency, token consumption, and cost at the per-URS and per-fold levels.
### Details:
- Timing: measure wall-clock time per URS generation and per fold; compute mean, median, and percentiles. Compare to baseline times to compute % reduction; store both absolute and relative metrics.
- Tokens: capture prompt and completion tokens per request via provider telemetry; sum per URS and per fold.
- Cost: map token counts to cost using current pricing; store per-URS and aggregated totals.
- Targets: compute whether mean time reduction meets 70% target; flag deviations.
- Persist metrics in a metrics.json per fold and a consolidated metrics.csv.

Enhanced MetricsCollector integrated:

- Detailed performance metrics via calculate_detailed_performance_metrics, including mean, median, and percentiles (25th, 75th, 90th, 95th), plus baseline comparisons against a 40h manual process with % time reduction.
- Precise wall-clock timing per URS and per fold; automatic aggregation and target evaluation for ≥70% reduction.
- Token telemetry captured (prompt + completion) per request; aggregated per URS and fold with token efficiency analysis.
- Real-time cost mapping using DeepSeek V3 pricing ($0.27 prompt / $1.10 completion per 1M tokens); per-URS and fold totals reported.
- Export capabilities: metrics.json per fold and consolidated CSV via export_performance_csv for external analysis.
- Full audit trail support aligned to GAMP-5.
- Validation completed: unit tests passing, integration tested with sample data; metrics calculations verified.

## 4. Compute accuracy metrics: coverage, FP/FN, and variance [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: From predictions vs. ground truth per URS, compute requirements coverage, false positive/negative rates, and variance across folds and repeated runs.
### Details:
- Define ground truth mapping of requirements per URS and predicted coverage outputs.

- FP/FN: compute rates per URS and fold; check targets <5% each.
- Variance: if multiple runs per fold, compute variance/standard deviation for each metric; otherwise, use across-fold variance. Flag metrics with variance >5%.

### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Consolidate all folds into a single report, compute confidence intervals, and run significance tests (p<0.05) comparing against baseline or alternative models.
### Details:
- Aggregation: merge per-fold metrics into a master table; compute means, standard deviations, and 95% CIs for key metrics (time reduction, cost, coverage, FP/FN).
- Significance: select appropriate paired tests (e.g., paired t-test or Wilcoxon) per URS comparing current system vs. baseline across the same folds; report p-values and effect sizes.
