# Task ID: 7
# Title: Compliance Validation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Add compliance validation (ALCOA+, 21 CFR Part 11, GAMP-5)
# Details:
Implement comprehensive compliance validation including ALCOA+ data integrity principles, 21 CFR Part 11 electronic records compliance, and GAMP-5 validation requirements. Include automated validation gates and reporting.

# Test Strategy:
Compliance validation tests, regulatory requirement verification, audit trail validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement ALCOA+ Data Integrity Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement system features that enforce ALCOA+ data integrity principles, ensuring all data is attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, complete, consistent, enduring, and available.
### Details:
Integrate audit trails, unique user authentication, time-stamped records, and data versioning. Ensure all data entries are traceable to their originator and modification history is preserved. Use automated data capture and validation mechanisms to minimize human error and enforce contemporaneous recording. Provide mechanisms for long-term data retention and accessibility in accordance with regulatory requirements.

## 2. Integrate 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Records Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement controls and features to ensure compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and electronic signatures.
### Details:
Add electronic signature functionality with multi-factor authentication, enforce secure user access controls, and implement system checks for record authenticity and integrity. Ensure all electronic records are protected against unauthorized access or modification. Maintain a secure, validated audit trail for all record-related actions, and provide mechanisms for record retrieval and review as required by regulatory authorities.

## 3. Apply GAMP-5 Validation Lifecycle Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Establish and document a validation lifecycle for the compliance system in accordance with GAMP-5 guidelines, covering risk assessment, specification, verification, and change management.
### Details:
Develop validation plans, user requirements specifications, functional specifications, and risk assessments. Implement verification protocols (IQ/OQ/PQ) and maintain traceability matrices. Set up change control procedures and periodic review processes to ensure ongoing compliance. Document all validation activities and outcomes for regulatory inspection.

## 4. Automate Validation Gates and Regulatory Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Develop automated validation gates to enforce compliance checkpoints and generate regulatory reports summarizing compliance status and audit findings.
### Details:
Implement automated workflows that trigger validation checks at key process stages (e.g., data entry, record modification, system updates). Generate real-time compliance dashboards and periodic reports detailing validation status, audit trail summaries, and any detected non-conformities. Ensure reports are exportable in formats suitable for regulatory submission and internal review.
