# Task ID: 26
# Title: Prepare Cross-Validation Dataset
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Setup all 17 URS documents for k=5 fold validation with stratified splitting based on GAMP category and complexity.
# Details:
Dataset requirements:
- 17 URS documents available (5 Cat3, 5 Cat4, 5 Cat5, 2 Ambiguous)
- 442 total requirements across all documents
- Complexity scores: 0.180-0.431 range
- Need 5-fold stratified splitting
- Stratify by GAMP category and complexity score

This enables statistically valid cross-validation for thesis.

# Test Strategy:
