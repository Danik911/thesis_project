# Task ID: 10
# Title: Fix Event Flow Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign event flow to prevent loops and ensure proper event production/consumption in LlamaIndex workflows
# Details:
Critical issue: LlamaIndex workflow creating infinite loops due to same event types being consumed and produced. Must redesign event flow with unique event types for each transition. Fix WorkflowCompletionEvent usage that causes premature termination. Ensure AgentResultEvent is properly produced in planning workflow.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test event flow transitions 2. Integration test workflow paths 3. Verify no infinite loops 4. Test AgentResultEvent production 5. Validate workflow completion

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze event flow and identify loop patterns [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Map all event consumers and producers in the workflow
### Details:
Identify where same event types are consumed and produced, document the GAMPCategorizationEvent loop issue, create event flow diagram

## 2. Redesign event types for unique transitions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create distinct event types for each workflow transition
### Details:
Ensure no step consumes and produces the same event type, separate input/output events for each step

## 3. Fix WorkflowCompletionEvent usage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove WorkflowCompletionEvent from intermediate steps
### Details:
Only use WorkflowCompletionEvent for final workflow completion, replace with proper intermediate events

## 4. Ensure AgentResultEvent production [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix planning workflow to produce AgentResultEvent
### Details:
Add logic to return StopEvent when no agents need coordination, ensure all consumed events are produced

## 5. Test event flow with all workflow paths [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive testing of redesigned event flow
### Details:
Test no infinite loops occur, verify all events are properly produced/consumed, test error paths
