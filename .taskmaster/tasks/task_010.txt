# Task ID: 10
# Title: Fix Event Flow Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign event flow to prevent loops and ensure proper event production/consumption in LlamaIndex workflows
# Details:
Critical issue: LlamaIndex workflow creating infinite loops due to same event types being consumed and produced. Must redesign event flow with unique event types for each transition. Fix WorkflowCompletionEvent usage that causes premature termination. Ensure AgentResultEvent is properly produced in planning workflow.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test event flow transitions 2. Integration test workflow paths 3. Verify no infinite loops 4. Test AgentResultEvent production 5. Validate workflow completion
