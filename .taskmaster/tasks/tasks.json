Dominance gap analysis (>0.20 gap = clear winner) is now based on real scores. Ambiguity thresholds are set to 0.65. Audit trail logging was added for regulatory compliance.

Correct rates applied: $0.14 per 1M prompt tokens and $0.28 per 1M completion tokens (OpenRouter DeepSeek V3). Fix committed in main/src/cross_validation/metrics_collector.py lines 141–142.
