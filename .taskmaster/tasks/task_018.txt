# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define compliance scope, acceptance criteria, and evidence templates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the validation scope across GAMP-5, 21 CFR Part 11, and ALCOA+, define measurable acceptance criteria, and prepare standardized evidence templates and a traceability matrix to link requirements to tests and results.
### Details:
- Inventory in-scope systems/modules, interfaces, and data flows.
- For GAMP-5, enumerate checks for: correct software category assignment, risk-based testing rationale, lifecycle coverage (URS→FRS/DDS→IQ/OQ/PQ), and documentation artifacts per V-model and QMS controls.
- For 21 CFR Part 11, define criteria for: complete audit trails, e-signature components (unique IDs, linking to records, meaning, time stamps), system access controls, and data integrity controls.
- For ALCOA+, create a 0–1 scoring rubric for each attribute; apply 2x weight for Original and Accurate; define target overall score > 9/10.
- Create standardized templates: URS/FRS/DDS checklists, risk assessment form, test plan/protocol, IQ/OQ/PQ scripts, audit trail review log, e-signature verification checklist, access control test scripts, ALCOA+ scoring sheet, gap log, and remediation plan.
- Build a traceability matrix linking requirements to test cases and objective evidence.

Implementation handoff to Subtask 18.2:

- Leverage existing models and evidence collector to auto-populate GAMP-5 inventory: systems/modules, interfaces, and data flows via EvidenceCollector sources; persist as Evidence and link to TraceabilityMatrix entries.

- Implement GAMP-5 assessor service:
  - Software category assignment engine with rules and overrides per system; capture rationale as Evidence and link to requirements in TraceabilityMatrix.
  - Risk-based testing rationale generator using impact, complexity, novelty, and supplier risk inputs; output recommended test depth for URS→FRS/DDS→IQ/OQ/PQ stages; record as ValidationTemplate instances.
  - Lifecycle coverage validator to check artifacts across URS, FRS/DDS, Test Plan, IQ/OQ/PQ; ensure objective evidence exists and is linked; flag gaps as Gap records.

- Part 11 assessment module:
  - Automated checks for audit trails, e-signature components (unique IDs, record linkage, meaning, timestamp), access controls, and data integrity; generate Evidence with verification and reliability scores; create targeted test scripts from templates.

- ALCOA+ scorer:
  - Apply 0–1 rubric with 2x weights for Original and Accurate; compute per-artifact and overall scores; fail threshold if overall ≤ 9/10; create Gap and RemediationPlan entries automatically when below target.

- Template instantiation:
  - Auto-generate standardized URS/FRS/DDS checklists, risk assessment forms, test plans/protocols, IQ/OQ/PQ scripts, audit trail review logs, e-signature verification checklists, access control test scripts, ALCOA+ scoring sheets, gap logs, and remediation plans; bind each template to ValidationTemplate with versioning and approver fields.

- Traceability:
  - Build and maintain bidirectional TraceabilityMatrix links from requirements to test cases and objective evidence; compute coverage; surface uncovered requirements and orphan tests as Gap items with severity.

- Diagnostics and controls:
  - Enforce NO FALLBACKS behavior with explicit error surfacing and Pydantic validation on all assessor inputs/outputs.
  - Capture complete audit trail of assessor decisions, timestamps, and approvers.

Deliverables for 18.2:
- GAMP5Assessor class with methods: assign_categories(), generate_risk_rationale(), validate_lifecycle_coverage(), assess_part11(), score_alcoa_plus(), instantiate_templates(), update_traceability().
- Default rule sets and checklists for category assignment, risk factors, lifecycle artifacts, and Part 11 criteria.
- Coverage and compliance report generator summarizing category map, risk-based testing plan, lifecycle completeness, Part 11 conformance, ALCOA+ score, gaps, and remediation plans.

## 2. GAMP-5 compliance assessment and lifecycle validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess system categorization, risk-based validation approach, lifecycle integration, and documentation against GAMP-5 guidance and produce objective evidence.
### Details:
- Determine software and hardware categories and justify classification; ensure scaling of validation effort matches category and risk.
- Verify lifecycle artifacts: URS, FRS, DDS, risk assessment, validation plan, test plan, IQ/OQ/PQ, reports, and traceability matrix.
- Evaluate risk-based testing appropriateness: confirm critical thinking, patient/product/data risk focus, and proportionate testing depth.
- Execute or review IQ/OQ/PQ: confirm installation/configuration baselines (IQ), operational functionality vs. specifications (OQ), and performance in intended use (PQ).
- Check documentation standards: version control, approvals, objective evidence, deviations, and closure.
- Record findings in the gap log and attach evidence to the traceability matrix.

## 3. 21 CFR Part 11 verification: audit trails, e-signatures, access, and data integrity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify electronic records and signatures, audit trail completeness, access controls, and data integrity controls meet 21 CFR Part 11 requirements with 100% audit trail completeness target.
### Details:
- Audit trail: validate configuration covers create/read/update/delete, configuration changes, security events; verify time-synchronization, tamper-evidence, and reporting/export; sample end-to-end transactions for completeness and readability.
- Electronic signatures: validate unique user IDs, signature components (username/password or biometric), meaning/intent captured, linkage to records, time/date stamps, and signer attribution; test signature manifestations on print/view/export.
- Access control: test role-based access, least privilege, account provisioning/deprovisioning, password/2FA policies, session controls, lockouts, and logging of privileged actions.
- Data integrity: verify controls for accuracy, record protection, versioning, secure storage, backup/restore, and data transfer integrity (hashes/secure protocols).
- Document all test cases, objective evidence, deviations, and residual risks; update the gap log.

## 4. ALCOA+ data integrity assessment and scoring [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate data lifecycle practices against ALCOA+ attributes using the defined rubric, compute weighted score, and identify gaps to meet >9/10 target.
### Details:
- Assess each attribute across representative records and workflows:
  - Attributable: unique user linkage and traceability.
  - Legible: readability and durable formats.
  - Contemporaneous: timely entries and time-stamps.
  - Original (2x): source records preserved; validated copies traceable.
  - Accurate (2x): correctness, controlled changes, reconciliations.
  - Complete: inclusion of all data (including changes and metadata).
  - Consistent: chronological order, formats, time sync.
  - Enduring: protected storage and retention.
  - Available: retrieval on demand within SLA.
- Score each attribute 0–1, apply weights, and compute overall score; analyze by process area.
- Capture objective evidence and populate the gap log for any attribute <1 or overall < target.

## 5. Consolidated gaps log, risk-ranked remediation plan, and approvals [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Synthesize findings from GAMP-5, 21 CFR Part 11, and ALCOA+ into a single gaps log; prioritize remediation with owners, timelines, and re-test plans; obtain stakeholder approvals.
### Details:
- Normalize gap entries: description, regulatory reference, severity (risk to patient/product/data, compliance exposure), root cause, impacted components.
- Prioritize remediation using risk ranking; define corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs), owners, due dates, required configuration/process changes, and documentation updates.
- Update validation deliverables as needed (risk assessment, test plan, SOPs) and plan re-tests/regression.
- Produce a consolidated validation report summarizing results vs. acceptance criteria and attach traceability matrix and evidence index.
- Route for QA/CSV/compliance approvals and archive per retention policy.
