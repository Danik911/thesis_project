# Task ID: 12
# Title: Fix Categorization Accuracy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix false ambiguity detection in categorization agent for clear Category 5 cases like URS-003
# Details:
High priority issue: URS-003 incorrectly detected as ambiguous despite clear Category 5 indicators. Need to implement dominance gap analysis (>0.20 gap = clear winner), adjust ambiguity thresholds to 0.65, and ensure Category 5 custom development is properly detected.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test ambiguity logic with various confidence scenarios 2. Validate URS-003 as Category 5 3. Test all URS cases (001-005) 4. Verify no false positives 5. Check regulatory compliance
