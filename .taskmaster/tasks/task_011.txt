# Task ID: 11
# Title: Fix Workflow State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix LlamaIndex context storage and retrieval mechanisms that are causing 'planning_event not found in state' errors
# Details:
Critical issue: ctx.set() and ctx.get() operations failing for planning_event storage. Need to debug state management, implement proper error handling, add state validation at each workflow step, create fallback mechanisms for state recovery, and add comprehensive state tracing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test context storage operations 2. Verify state persistence across steps 3. Test error recovery mechanisms 4. Validate state tracing 5. End-to-end state management test
