# Task ID: 4
# Title: Parallel Agent Execution System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement parallel agent execution (context, SME, research) with num_workers=3
# Details:
Create the multi-agent system with Context Provider Agent (RAG/CAG), SME Agents (domain experts), and Research Agent (regulatory updates). Implement parallel execution with comprehensive error handling, timeout protection, and partial failure recovery.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for individual agents, integration tests for parallel execution, timeout and error handling validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Agent Interfaces and Workflow Contracts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define clear interfaces and contracts for the Context Provider Agent, SME Agents, and Research Agent, specifying input/output schemas, error signaling, and timeout semantics.
### Details:
Specify Pydantic models or equivalent for agent requests and responses. Document expected behaviors, error codes, and timeout handling for each agent type. Ensure compatibility with LlamaIndex workflow orchestration and event system foundations.

## 2. Implement Individual Agent Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for the Context Provider Agent (RAG/CAG), SME Agents (domain experts), and Research Agent (regulatory updates), ensuring each can process requests independently.
### Details:
For each agent, implement request handling, context management, and domain-specific processing. Integrate with LlamaIndex for retrieval and generation as appropriate. Include robust error handling and logging within each agent.

## 3. Develop Parallel Execution Orchestrator [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create an orchestrator to manage parallel execution of the three agent types using num_workers=3, supporting concurrent task dispatch and result aggregation.
### Details:
Implement a workflow manager leveraging LlamaIndex or equivalent parallel execution primitives. Ensure agents are invoked concurrently, respecting the num_workers=3 constraint. Aggregate results and maintain execution context for each agent.

## 4. Integrate Comprehensive Error Handling and Timeout Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Add error handling and timeout logic to the orchestrator and agents, ensuring graceful degradation, error propagation, and recovery from partial failures.
### Details:
Implement per-agent and global timeouts. Capture and log all exceptions, returning structured error responses. Design recovery strategies for partial failures (e.g., retry, fallback, or partial result return). Ensure orchestrator can continue processing if one or more agents fail.

## 5. Implement Partial Failure Recovery and Result Merging [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Enable the system to merge successful agent results and handle missing or failed agent outputs, providing a coherent aggregated response.
### Details:
Design logic to merge agent outputs, annotate partial results, and flag missing data. Ensure downstream consumers can distinguish between complete and partial responses. Document recovery and merging strategies.

## 6. Validate System with End-to-End and Stress Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Conduct comprehensive end-to-end and stress tests of the parallel agent execution system, including error, timeout, and recovery scenarios.
### Details:
Develop test suites simulating realistic and edge-case workflows. Measure system throughput, latency, and robustness under load. Validate that all error handling, timeout, and recovery mechanisms function as intended.
