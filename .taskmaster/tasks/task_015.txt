# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Priority 1 Prompt Improvements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement immediate prompt engineering fixes for the pharmaceutical test generation system based on the improvement plan
# Details:
Week 1 quick wins to optimize prompts:
1. Reduce OQ generator repetition (60% size reduction)
2. Add structured JSON examples to categorization agent
3. Implement basic Chain-of-Thought reasoning
4. Clean verbose prompts across all agents
5. Add DeepSeek V3 specific formatting

Target: 30-40% token reduction, >95% parsing success

# Test Strategy:
Test improved prompts with existing test data in main/tests/test_data/gamp5_test_data/testing_data.md. Measure token usage, parsing success rate, and generation time. Verify regulatory compliance maintained.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Reduce OQ Generator Repetition [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor OQ generator prompts to eliminate excessive repetition of test_count
### Details:
Current prompt mentions {test_count} 20+ times. Reduce to 2-3 clear mentions. Streamline BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT and CATEGORY_SPECIFIC_PROMPTS in main/src/agents/oq_generator/templates.py

## 2. Add JSON Examples to Categorization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add structured JSON examples for few-shot learning in categorization agent
### Details:
Update prompts in main/src/agents/categorization/agent.py to include clear JSON output examples. Implement few-shot learning patterns for better OSS model compatibility.

## 3. Implement Chain-of-Thought Reasoning [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add CoT reasoning structure to categorization agent for improved accuracy
### Details:
Implement step-by-step reasoning: 1) Identify software type, 2) Check customization level, 3) Apply GAMP-5 criteria, 4) Determine category with confidence. Update system prompts in agent.py

## 4. Optimize for DeepSeek V3 [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add DeepSeek V3 specific prompt formatting and optimizations
### Details:
Implement DeepSeek V3 optimizations: reduce verbosity by 40%, use clear instruction formatting, optimize for 671B MoE architecture. Update all agent prompts for OSS model compatibility.

## 5. Test and Validate Improvements [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Test all prompt improvements with existing test data
### Details:
Run improved prompts against testing_data.md. Measure: token usage reduction (target: -40%), parsing success (target: >95%), generation time (target: <5min), compliance maintained (100%). Document results.
