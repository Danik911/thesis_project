# Task ID: 1
# Title: Event System Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive event definitions for all agent communications with Pydantic validation
# Details:
Implement URSIngestionEvent, GAMPCategorizationEvent, PlanningEvent, AgentRequestEvent, AgentResultEvent, ConsultationRequiredEvent, UserDecisionEvent, TestGenerationEvent, ValidationEvent, and ErrorRecoveryEvent classes with proper validation and error handling. These events form the foundation of the entire workflow system.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for event validation, serialization/deserialization, and error cases

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Base Event Model with Pydantic Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a reusable base event class using Pydantic's BaseModel, including common fields (e.g., event_id, timestamp, event_type) and foundational validation logic.
### Details:
Create a BaseEvent class inheriting from pydantic.BaseModel. Include shared attributes such as event_id (UUID), timestamp (datetime), and event_type (str). Implement basic validation using type hints and, if needed, @field_validator for cross-field or custom logic. Ensure the base class provides a consistent interface for all event types.

## 2. Implement Specific Event Classes with Field-Level Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create individual event classes (URSIngestionEvent, GAMPCategorizationEvent, PlanningEvent, AgentRequestEvent, AgentResultEvent, ConsultationRequiredEvent, UserDecisionEvent, TestGenerationEvent, ValidationEvent, ErrorRecoveryEvent) inheriting from the base event, each with their own fields and validation logic.
### Details:
For each event type, define a subclass of BaseEvent. Specify all required and optional fields using Pydantic type annotations. Use @field_validator decorators to enforce constraints (e.g., non-empty strings, valid enums, positive numbers) as appropriate for each event's semantics. Document each class and its fields for clarity.

## 3. Add Custom Validation and Error Handling Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance event classes with custom validation methods and robust error handling to ensure data integrity and clear error reporting.
### Details:
Implement custom @field_validator methods for complex validation rules (e.g., cross-field dependencies, conditional requirements). Ensure that all validation errors raise Pydantic's ValidationError with informative messages. Where necessary, override model methods to provide additional error context or normalization.

## 4. Implement Serialization and Deserialization Methods [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Provide methods for serializing event objects to JSON and deserializing from JSON, ensuring compatibility with the workflow system's communication protocols.
### Details:
Leverage Pydantic's .model_dump() and .model_validate_json() methods for serialization and deserialization. Add helper methods or classmethods as needed for custom encoding/decoding (e.g., handling datetime or enum fields). Ensure all event classes can be reliably converted to and from JSON representations.

## 5. Document Event Definitions and Validation Contracts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Produce comprehensive documentation for all event classes, their fields, validation rules, and error handling behaviors to support maintainability and onboarding.
### Details:
Generate docstrings for each event class and field, describing expected data, validation logic, and error cases. Create a reference document (e.g., Markdown or Sphinx) summarizing all event types, their schemas, and usage examples. Ensure documentation is accessible to both developers and system integrators.
