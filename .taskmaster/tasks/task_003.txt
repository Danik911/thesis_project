# Task ID: 3
# Title: Integrate Context Provider as Categorization Tool
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Successfully integrated context_provider agent as a FunctionTool to boost categorization confidence, with enhanced error handling, confidence logic, and agent workflow.
# Details:
The context_provider agent has been integrated as a FunctionTool wrapper within the categorization agent, enabling access to the GAMP-5 regulatory knowledge base, precedent matching, and guidance validation. Integration includes an async-to-sync bridge using asyncio.run() with a ThreadPoolExecutor fallback, comprehensive context request mapping from categorization inputs, and explicit error handling with no fallback logic. The enhanced confidence logic uses an 'enhanced_confidence_tool' that combines base confidence with a context quality boost (+0.05 to +0.20 based on context quality), factoring in coverage and document count multipliers for realistic, conservative, and compliant confidence enhancement. The agent now supports an 'enable_context_provider' parameter in create_gamp_categorization_agent, a revised system prompt for a 3-tool workflow (analysis → context → enhanced_confidence), and increased max_iterations to 20 for context-enhanced workflows, while maintaining backward compatibility. Technical features include ChromaDB queries with pharmaceutical collections, test strategy mapping by GAMP category, URS document section extraction, full audit trail and Phoenix instrumentation, and explicit error handling throughout. Validation confirms agent creation, tool integration, and enhanced confidence are functional and compliant, with a +0.15-0.20 confidence boost achieved.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate that the categorization agent correctly invokes the context_provider_tool as a FunctionTool and receives context from the GAMP-5 knowledge base.
2. Test async-to-sync bridging by simulating both normal and fallback execution paths.
3. Verify comprehensive context request mapping for a variety of categorization inputs, ensuring correct context retrieval and mapping.
4. Confirm that explicit error handling triggers on all failure modes, with no fallback logic or silent errors.
5. Test the enhanced_confidence_tool to ensure confidence is boosted by +0.05 to +0.20 based on context quality (high/medium/low/poor), and that coverage factor and document count multipliers are applied.
6. Ensure the agent's enable_context_provider parameter toggles context integration as expected and that the workflow supports up to 20 iterations.
7. Validate ChromaDB queries, test strategy mapping, and URS section extraction for accuracy and completeness.
8. Review audit trail and Phoenix instrumentation for completeness and compliance.
9. Confirm backward compatibility with previous agent configurations.
10. Perform end-to-end validation to ensure the integration meets all regulatory and compliance requirements.
