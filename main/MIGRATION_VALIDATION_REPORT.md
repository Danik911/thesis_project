---

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### CRITICAL FIXES (Required for Production)

1. **Fix Import Issues**
   ```bash
   # Fix OpenAI import in generator_v2.py
   sed -i 's/OpenAI/LLM/g' src/agents/oq_generator/generator_v2.py
   
   # Update type hints to use LLM from config
   # Replace OpenAI type hints with LLM
   ```

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv add pdfplumber
   uv add any-other-missing-packages
   ```

3. **Fix Agent Class Exports**
   ```bash
   # Verify PlanningAgent class exists and is properly exported
   # Check __init__.py files for correct imports
   ```

### PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS (Recommended)

1. **Consider Faster Models**
   - Test with `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct` (3000 tps)
   - Evaluate speed vs quality tradeoffs

2. **Response Caching**
   - Cache common regulatory research
   - Store frequently used context

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Run multiple agents concurrently where possible
