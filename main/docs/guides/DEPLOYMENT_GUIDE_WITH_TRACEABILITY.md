```

### System Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for Phoenix observability)
- 8GB RAM minimum
- 10GB disk space for traces and logs

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Start Phoenix Observability
```bash
# Launch Phoenix container with correct port mapping
docker run -d \
  --name phoenix-server \
  -p 6006:6006 \
  arizephoenix/phoenix:latest

# Verify Phoenix is running
curl http://localhost:6006 && echo "Phoenix UI accessible"
```

### 2. Initialize ChromaDB
```bash
cd C:\Users\anteb\Desktop\Courses\Projects\thesis_project\main

# Ingest regulatory documents
python ingest_chromadb.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ 26 embeddings created
# ‚úÖ Collection 'pharmaceutical_regulations' ready
```

### 3. Verify Enhanced Traceability
```bash
# Run quick test to verify traceability logs
python test_direct_oq.py

# Look for these new log prefixes:
# [OQ-TRACE] - Workflow step tracking
# [OQ-RESOURCE] - Memory usage monitoring
# [OQ-BATCH] - Batch processing progress
```

---

## üìä Enhanced Traceability Features

### 1. Workflow Instance Tracking

Each workflow execution gets a unique 8-character ID for tracking:

```python
# Example log output
[OQ-TRACE] Creating OQ workflow instance: a3f8b2c1
[OQ-TRACE] [Workflow a3f8b2c1] STEP 1/3: start_oq_generation
[OQ-TRACE] [Workflow a3f8b2c1] STEP 2/3: generate_oq_tests
[OQ-TRACE] [Workflow a3f8b2c1] STEP 3/3: complete_workflow
```

**Benefits**:
- Track specific workflow instances in logs
- Correlate issues to specific executions
- Monitor concurrent workflow runs

### 2. Resource Monitoring

Memory usage is tracked at key points:

```python
# Example resource logs
[OQ-RESOURCE] Initial memory usage: 141.25 MB
[OQ-RESOURCE] Memory before generation: 145.50 MB
[OQ-RESOURCE] Memory after generation: 189.75 MB (delta: +44.25 MB)
[OQ-RESOURCE] Final memory after cleanup: 142.00 MB
```

**Monitoring Points**:
- Workflow initialization
- Before/after each major step
- After resource cleanup

### 3. Batch Progress Tracking

Test generation progress with real-time updates:

```python
# Example batch logs
[OQ-BATCH] Expected batches: 5
[OQ-BATCH] Batch configuration: 10 tests in batches of 2
[OQ-BATCH] Processing batch 1/5...
[OQ-BATCH] Batch 1 complete: 2 tests generated
[OQ-BATCH] Generation summary: 5 batches processed
```

### 4. Heartbeat Logging

Long-running operations show periodic status:

```python
# Heartbeat during OQ generation
[OQ-TRACE] ‚è±Ô∏è Generation in progress... 10s elapsed
[OQ-TRACE] ‚è±Ô∏è Generation in progress... 20s elapsed
[OQ-TRACE] ‚è±Ô∏è Generation in progress... 30s elapsed
[OQ-TRACE] üéâ SUCCESS: OQ generation completed in 35.42 seconds!
```

**Heartbeat Intervals**:
- Every 10 seconds during OQ generation
- Every 15 seconds during research agent execution
- Automatic cancellation on completion

### 5. Step Timing Analysis

Performance metrics for each workflow step:

```python
# Step timing logs
[OQ-TRACE] Step 'start_oq_generation' completed in 0.15s
[OQ-TRACE] Step 'categorization' completed in 0.85s
[OQ-TRACE] Step 'parallel_agents' completed in 75.30s
[OQ-TRACE] Step 'generate_oq_tests' completed in 185.20s
[OQ-TRACE] Total workflow duration: 315.50s
```

## üîç Monitoring in Production

### Real-time Monitoring via Phoenix UI

Access Phoenix at `http://localhost:6006` to view:

1. **Traces Dashboard**
   - Total spans per workflow (expect 126-131)
   - Agent execution timeline
   - Error spans highlighted in red

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - P50/P95/P99 latencies
   - Throughput graphs
   - Resource utilization

3. **Custom Span Attributes**
   ```json
   {
     "workflow.id": "a3f8b2c1",
     "workflow.step": "generate_oq_tests",
     "agent.type": "oq_generator",
     "batch.current": 3,
     "batch.total": 5,
     "memory.usage_mb": 189.75,
     "compliance.gamp_category": 3
   }
   ```

### Log Aggregation

Configure your log aggregation system to parse enhanced logs:

```yaml
# Logstash/Fluentd parser configuration
grok {
  match => {
    "message" => "\[%{DATA:trace_type}\] \[Workflow %{DATA:workflow_id}\] %{GREEDYDATA:message}"
  }
}

# Extract memory metrics
if [trace_type] == "OQ-RESOURCE" {
  grok {
    match => {
      "message" => "Memory.*: %{NUMBER:memory_mb:float} MB"
    }
  }
}
```

### Alerting Rules

Set up alerts for production monitoring:

```yaml
# Prometheus alert rules
groups:
  - name: pharmaceutical_workflow
    rules:
      - alert: WorkflowTimeout
        expr: workflow_duration_seconds > 600
        annotations:
          summary: "Workflow exceeded 10 minute timeout"
          
      - alert: HighMemoryUsage
        expr: workflow_memory_mb > 500
        annotations:
          summary: "Workflow using >500MB memory"
          
      - alert: OQGenerationFailure
        expr: oq_generation_failures_total > 2
        for: 5m
        annotations:
          summary: "Multiple OQ generation failures detected"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting with Enhanced Traceability

### Issue: Workflow Hanging

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check heartbeat logs - last heartbeat indicates hang point
2. Look for workflow ID in traces: `grep "Workflow abc123" logs/`
3. Check memory at hang point: `[OQ-RESOURCE]` logs
4. Verify resource cleanup executed

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Review step timing logs: `[OQ-TRACE] Step 'X' completed in Ys`
2. Check batch processing times: `[OQ-BATCH]` logs
3. Monitor memory growth between steps
4. Verify Phoenix spans show expected counts

### Issue: Resource Exhaustion

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Track memory deltas: `[OQ-RESOURCE] ... (delta: +X MB)`
2. Verify cleanup logs: `[OQ-TRACE] Workflow cleanup complete`
3. Check for multiple workflow instances without cleanup
4. Monitor system resources during execution

## üìà Performance Baselines

### Expected Metrics (Production)

| Component | Expected Duration | Memory Usage | Spans |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Categorization | <1 second | +5 MB | 5-10 |
| Context Provider | 3-6 seconds | +20 MB | 15-20 |
| Research Agent | 60-90 seconds | +50 MB | 10-15 |
| SME Agent | 60-80 seconds | +40 MB | 10-15 |
| OQ Generation | 150-200 seconds | +80 MB | 30-40 |
| **Total Workflow** | **5-6 minutes** | **~200 MB peak** | **126-131** |

### Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Workflow completes in <10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Memory usage stays below 500MB
- ‚úÖ All heartbeats appear at expected intervals
- ‚úÖ Resource cleanup reduces memory to baseline
- ‚úÖ Phoenix captures 120+ spans

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Key Management
```bash
# Use environment variables, never hardcode
export OPENAI_API_KEY=$(vault read -field=key secret/openai)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=$(vault read -field=key secret/openrouter)
```

### Trace Data Security
- Traces may contain sensitive URS content
- Store trace files with appropriate permissions
- Rotate trace logs regularly (recommended: 7 days)
- Encrypt trace data at rest

### Audit Trail Compliance
- All traces include GAMP-5 categorization
- Cryptographic signatures in audit logs
- Tamper-evident chain of signatures
- 21 CFR Part 11 compliance maintained

---

## üìù Deployment Validation

### Post-Deployment Tests

1. **Single Run Test**
   ```bash
   python main.py tests/test_data/gamp5_test_data/testing_data.md --verbose
   # Verify: Complete workflow, trace logs present
   ```

2. **Consecutive Runs Test**
   ```bash
   # Run twice without restart
   python test_direct_oq.py
   python test_direct_oq.py
   # Verify: Both complete successfully
   ```

3. **Trace Validation**
   ```bash
   # Check trace files generated
   ls -la logs/traces/*.jsonl
   
   # Verify Phoenix spans
   curl http://localhost:6006/api/traces | jq '.count'
   # Expected: 126-131 spans per workflow
   ```

4. **Resource Cleanup Validation**
   ```bash
   # Monitor memory during execution
   python -c "
   import psutil
   import time
   import subprocess
   
   proc = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'test_direct_oq.py'])
   while proc.poll() is None:
       mem = psutil.Process(proc.pid).memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024
       print(f'Memory: {mem:.2f} MB')
       time.sleep(2)
   "
   # Verify: Memory returns to baseline after completion
   ```
