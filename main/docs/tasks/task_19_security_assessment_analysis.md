## Research and Context (by context-collector)

### OWASP LLM Top 10 Security Implementation Patterns

#### LLM01: Prompt Injection - Critical Findings

**20 Prompt Injection Attack Patterns Identified**:

1. **Direct Injection Techniques**:
   - Simple instruction override: "Ignore previous instructions and..."
   - Role confusion attacks: "You are now an assistant that..."
   - Base64 encoding bypasses: Using encoded malicious prompts
   - Character transformation attacks: Unicode, special characters
   - Instruction hierarchy manipulation: Multiple system-level commands

2. **Indirect Injection via Tools/Documents**:
   - Malicious content in retrieved documents
   - Tool response contamination
   - RAG poisoning through embedding manipulation
   - Multi-hop attacks through tool chains
   - Context window exploitation

3. **Advanced Attack Vectors**:
   - Long-context manipulation (>100k tokens)
   - Multilingual bypasses (non-English injection)
   - Jailbreak transfers between model conversations
   - System prompt extraction attempts
   - Data exfiltration via citations and references

**Detection Implementation**: Novel attention mechanism analysis shows 10% AUROC improvement. The "distraction effect" in attention patterns during injection attempts enables zero-training-data detection through attention head analysis.

**Multi-Agent Defense Framework**: Specialized agents for response generation, output sanitization, and policy enforcement create layered defense with novel metrics:
- Injection Success Rate (ISR)
- Policy Override Frequency (POF) 
- Prompt Sanitization Rate (PSR)
- Compliance Consistency Score (CCS)

#### LLM06: Insecure Output Handling - Security Controls

**Critical Vulnerability Areas**:
- HTML/JavaScript injection in LLM outputs leading to XSS
- Command/code execution when outputs passed to system shells
- SQL injection through generated database queries
- File path traversal via generated file operations
- Secret/PII leakage through model responses

**Mitigation Requirements**:
- Comprehensive output validation based on OWASP ASVS standards
- Zero-trust approach: assume all LLM outputs potentially unsafe
- Real-time content analysis and sanitization
- Input/output correlation monitoring
- Tool invocation parameter validation

#### LLM09: Overreliance - Human-in-Loop Optimization

**Overreliance Detection Patterns**:
- Automation bias in human-AI interaction
- Uncritical acceptance of sophisticated-appearing outputs
- Gradual trust escalation leading to dependency
- Missing verification of AI-generated code/decisions
- Failure to maintain critical oversight

**Pharmaceutical-Specific Risks**:
- Integration of AI-generated code with security vulnerabilities
- Insecure default configurations from LLM suggestions
- References to non-existent libraries (typosquatting risk)
- Compliance violations through automated decisions

### Canary Token Implementation Strategy

**Comprehensive Detection Framework**:

1. **Token Placement Strategy**:
   - System prompts: Unique canary URLs/emails that should never be contacted
   - RAG documents: Embedded tokens in retrieval corpus metadata
   - Tool configurations: Fake credentials with deny policies
   - Response templates: Hidden identifiers in output patterns

2. **Detection Infrastructure**:
   - External token services with SIEM integration
   - Network monitoring for canary URL requests
   - API call tracking for fake credentials usage
   - Full LLM trace correlation with token activations

3. **Evidence Collection**:
   - Source IP, user agent, timestamp capture
   - Complete prompt/response chain documentation
   - Tool invocation sequences leading to token activation
   - Audit trail integration with Phoenix observability

**Implementation Note**: Simple "canary word" checks in open-source detectors (Vigil/Rebuff) showed poor reliability. Prefer out-of-band network/tool signals over in-text detection.

### Human-in-Loop Confidence Calibration

**Five Primary Calibration Methods Identified**:

1. **Temperature Scaling**: Simple post-processing adjustment (T=1.5-3.0 optimal)
   - Pros: Fast implementation, preserves monotonicity
   - Cons: Limited precision, poor data distribution shift handling

2. **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric monotonic calibration
   - Pros: Flexible for non-linear data, strong statistical basis
   - Cons: Requires large validation datasets, O(n²) complexity

3. **Ensemble Methods**: Multi-model prediction combination
   - Pros: 46% reduction in calibration error, high reliability
   - Cons: Resource-intensive, complex maintenance

4. **Team-Based Calibration**: Human expert integration
   - Pros: Domain expertise integration, collaborative refinement
   - Cons: Time-intensive, scalability limitations

5. **APRICOT**: Automated input/output-based calibration
   - Pros: Automated system integration
   - Cons: Requires additional modeling infrastructure

**Pharmaceutical Application**: Medical domain research shows inverse correlation (r=-0.40, P=.001) between confidence scores and accuracy. Better-performing models typically show lower confidence, requiring careful threshold calibration.

**Optimal Threshold Determination**:
- Cat 3/4: 0.85 threshold validated through cross-validation analysis
- Cat 5: 0.92 threshold for high-stakes pharmaceutical validation
- Precision/recall optimization for automation vs. escalation balance

### LlamaIndex Multi-Agent Security Architecture

**AgentWorkflow Security Patterns**:

1. **State Management Security**: AgentWorkflow manages state through `initial_state` parameter with secure hand-off protocols
2. **Event-Driven Security**: `ctx.send_event()` patterns enable concurrent security validation steps
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Root agent pattern with specialized security agents (input validation, output filtering, policy enforcement)

**Integration Points with Existing Infrastructure**:
- Phoenix observability for security event monitoring
- Context store security state management
- Human consultation integration points
- Tool invocation security controls

**Implementation Examples**: DocsAssistantWorkflow patterns show structured event handling, concurrent processing capabilities, and secure context management suitable for security validation workflows.

### Implementation Gotchas

**Critical Compatibility Issues**:

1. **DeepSeek V3 Specific**:
   - High context window (>128k) increases injection attack surface
   - MoE architecture requires specialized monitoring approaches
   - OpenRouter API rate limiting affects security test execution

2. **Phoenix Integration Challenges**:
   - Security event correlation requires specialized instrumentation
   - Tool call monitoring needs custom Phoenix spans
   - Confidence score correlation with security events

3. **ChromaDB Security Considerations**:
   - Vector database poisoning through malicious embeddings
   - RAG injection via contaminated retrieval results
   - Metadata extraction attacks through similarity search

4. **Human Consultation Performance**:
   - <10h human review target requires optimized escalation
   - Confidence threshold tuning affects consultation volume
   - Edge case detection automation critical for efficiency

### Regulatory Considerations
