### Cross-Validation Methodology Framework

**Experimental Design Approach:**
Based on pharmaceutical research standards, the cross-validation methodology employed:

1. **Subject-wise Cross-validation**: Ensures all data from individual documents kept together in training/testing sets
2. **Stratified Sampling**: Maintains GAMP category distribution across folds
3. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 1,000 bootstrap samples for robust statistical inference
4. **Nested Cross-validation**: Inner loop for hyperparameter tuning, outer loop for unbiased performance estimation
5. **Temporal Validation**: Production vs validation mode testing to ensure consistency

**Statistical Methods Applied:**
- One-sample tests vs industry baselines
- Paired t-test for dual-mode comparison  
- One-way ANOVA for GAMP categories
- Bootstrap confidence intervals
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)
- Multiple comparison corrections (Tukey HSD)

**Validation Sample Characteristics:**
- Total documents analyzed: 17 URS documents
- GAMP distribution: Category 3 (29%), Category 4 (29%), Category 5 (29%), Ambiguous (12%)
- Tests generated: 120 total (30 per category)
- Cross-validation sample size: 4 documents for dual-mode testing
- Bootstrap sample size: 30 for confidence intervals
