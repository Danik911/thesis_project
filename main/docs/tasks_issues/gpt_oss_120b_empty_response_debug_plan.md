# Debug Plan: GPT-OSS-120B Empty Response Issue

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on research and code analysis:

1. **Working Path**: LLMConfig.get_llm() → OpenRouterLLM → _make_api_request() → Returns content
2. **Failing Path**: Direct API calls → Empty string responses
3. **Key Research Finding**: GPT-OSS-120B uses "harmony response format" with multi-channel outputs

## Hypothesis

The GPT-OSS-120B model uses a special harmony response format that may require:
- Specific response parsing to extract the "final" channel
- Provider-specific handling that OpenRouterLLM implements correctly
- Additional parameters or headers that direct API calls are missing

## Solution Steps

1. **Compare API calls**: Run both direct API and OpenRouterLLM side-by-side with identical parameters
2. **Analyze response structure**: Check if direct API returns structured harmony format instead of simple string
3. **Test response parsing**: Check if direct API responses need special parsing for harmony format
4. **Validate headers**: Confirm all headers match exactly between working and failing calls
5. **Test minimal fix**: Implement proper response parsing for direct API calls

## Risk Assessment

- **Low risk**: This is debugging existing functionality, not changing production code
- **Rollback plan**: All changes are in test files only

## Compliance Validation

- **GAMP-5 implications**: Understanding proper API usage is critical for reliable pharmaceutical testing
- **Audit requirements**: Proper error handling and diagnostics are required
