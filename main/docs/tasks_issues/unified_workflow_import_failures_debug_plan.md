# Debug Plan: Unified Workflow Import Failures

## Root Cause Analysis

### Sequential Thinking Analysis Results

**Primary Issue**: 9+ missing model classes and 4 missing core modules preventing unified workflow from starting

**Specific Failures Identified**:

1. **Missing Model Classes in `src/core/models.py`**:
   - ‚ùå MonitoringConfiguration
   - ‚ùå OutputConfiguration  
   - ‚ùå QualityThresholds
   - ‚ùå TestPlan
   - ‚ùå ValidationReport
   - ‚ùå WorkflowConfiguration

2. **Missing Core Modules**:
   - ‚ùå `src/core/error_handler.py`
   - ‚ùå `src/core/monitoring.py`
   - ‚ùå `src/core/output_management.py`
   - ‚ùå `src/core/event_logger.py`

3. **OQ Model Import Issues**:
   - ‚ùå Import path issues between core models and OQ generator models
   - ‚ùå Conditional imports causing import failures

4. **AgentRequestEvent Validation Issues**:
   - ‚ùå Field validation still failing due to missing required fields
   - ‚ùå Event structure doesn't match workflow expectations

## Solution Steps

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Add Missing Model Classes (COMPLETED)
- [x] Added WorkflowConfiguration class with categorization timeout, agent execution settings
- [x] Added MonitoringConfiguration class with Phoenix tracing, performance monitoring
- [x] Added OutputConfiguration class with file generation settings
- [x] Added QualityThresholds class with compliance thresholds
- [x] Added TestPlan class with GAMP strategy and requirements
- [x] Added ValidationReport class with comprehensive validation results
- [x] Fixed OQ model imports with stub classes for compatibility

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Create Missing Core Modules (COMPLETED)
- [x] Created `error_handler.py` with WorkflowError, ValidationError, ErrorHandler classes
- [x] Created `monitoring.py` with WorkflowMonitor, PerformanceMetrics, MonitoringEvent classes
- [x] Created `output_management.py` with OutputManager, FileCreationResult classes
- [x] Created `event_logger.py` with EventLogger, AuditLogEntry classes
- [x] All modules follow pharmaceutical compliance requirements (NO FALLBACKS)

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Test Import Resolution (IN PROGRESS)
1. [x] Created import test script (`test_imports.py`)
2. [x] Created debug import script (`debug_imports.py`) 
3. [x] Created workflow execution test (`test_workflow_execution.py`)
4. [ ] Execute import tests to verify all dependencies resolve
5. [ ] Fix any remaining import issues

### üîú Phase 4: Validate Real Workflow Execution
1. [ ] Test workflow can instantiate without errors
2. [ ] Test workflow can accept StartEvent with document path
3. [ ] Test workflow steps can execute without dependency errors
4. [ ] Verify all agents can be loaded (Context, Research, SME, OQ Generator)
5. [ ] Test ChromaDB integration works correctly

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Impacts
- **Medium Risk**: Additional dependency issues may surface during execution
- **Low Risk**: Agent-specific imports may need adjustments
- **Low Risk**: ChromaDB configuration may need updates

### Rollback Plan
- All new files created can be safely removed if issues arise
- Original unified_workflow.py unchanged - only added missing dependencies
- Can revert to previous simplified workflow if needed

## Compliance Validation

### GAMP-5 Implications
- ‚úÖ All new modules maintain audit trail requirements
- ‚úÖ No fallback values implemented - explicit error handling only
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for regulatory compliance
- ‚úÖ Structured error handling with recovery strategies

### Audit Requirements
- All changes maintain pharmaceutical compliance standards
- Error handling follows explicit failure patterns
- Event logging provides complete audit trails
- Configuration classes support validation requirements

## Iteration Log

### Iteration 1: Analysis and Planning
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Analyzed import failures using sequential thinking
- **Result**: Identified 9+ missing classes and 4 missing modules
- **Lesson**: Import dependencies more complex than expected

### Iteration 2: Missing Models Implementation  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Added all 6 missing model classes to models.py
- **Result**: All core model imports should now resolve
- **Lesson**: OQ model imports needed stub classes for compatibility

### Iteration 3: Core Modules Creation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
- **Action**: Created 4 missing core modules with comprehensive functionality
- **Result**: All core module imports should now resolve
- **Lesson**: Each module needed pharmaceutical compliance features

### Iteration 4: Import Testing
- **Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **Action**: Created test scripts to validate import resolution
- **Expected Result**: All imports resolve and workflow can instantiate
- **Next Step**: Execute tests and fix any remaining issues

### Iteration 5: End-to-End Validation (Planned)
- **Status**: üîú PENDING
- **Action**: Test real workflow execution with document processing
- **Expected Result**: Workflow runs end-to-end with real agents
- **Success Criteria**: Document processed, GAMP categorization, test generation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] All model imports resolve without errors
- [ ] All core module imports resolve without errors  
- [ ] UnifiedTestGenerationWorkflow can be imported
- [ ] Workflow instance can be created without exceptions

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- [ ] Workflow accepts StartEvent with document path
- [ ] All workflow steps can execute their initialization
- [ ] Agent lazy loading works correctly
- [ ] ChromaDB integration functions properly
- [ ] DeepSeek V3 LLM calls work correctly

## Critical Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **NO FALLBACKS RULE**: All implementations follow explicit failure patterns - no masking of real system behavior

‚úÖ **Compliance First**: All solutions maintain pharmaceutical regulatory requirements

üîß **Systematic Approach**: Each phase builds on previous phase success

üìã **Test-Driven**: Validate each fix before proceeding to next phase
