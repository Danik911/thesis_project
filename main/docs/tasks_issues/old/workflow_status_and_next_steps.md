# Pharmaceutical Multi-Agent Workflow Status Report

**Date**: August 3, 2025  
**Session Summary**: Debugging and fixing OQ test generation workflow issues

## üîç Current Status Overview

### What Works ‚úÖ
1. **Research Agent Timeout** - Fixed and tested
   - Increased from 30s to 300s in `unified_workflow.py`
   - Successfully completes FDA API calls (~75s typical)
   - Confirmed working in full workflow run

2. **SME Agent JSON Parsing** - Fixed and tested
   - Implemented balanced bracket parsing in `sme_agent.py`
   - Fixed array/object detection order
   - Tested with real API: Successfully parses array of 10 recommendations
   - Test file: `test_sme_api.py` confirms working

3. **Basic Workflow Infrastructure** - Operational
   - Categorization completes (Category 5, 100% confidence)
   - Context Provider executes (but finds no documents)
   - Phoenix observability connects successfully
   - Audit logging works

### What Doesn't Work ‚ùå

1. **OQ Test Generation** - CRITICAL FAILURE
   - Workflow reaches OQ generation but times out
   - Error: "Request timed out" after 3 retries
   - No test suite JSON files generated
   - Workflow log shows it ran for 6.8 minutes before failing

2. **Unicode Encoding Issues** - Partially blocking
   - Fixed in `simple_tracer.py` (replaced emojis with ASCII)
   - Still present in other parts of codebase
   - Causes crashes in Context Provider and Research Agent logging

3. **SME Regulatory Considerations** - JSON parsing error
   - Timeline format validation too strict
   - Expects single value but gets "design_phase/implementation_phase/validation_phase"

## üìÅ Files Changed

### Core Fixes Applied
1. **`main/src/core/unified_workflow.py`**
   ```python
   # Added timeout mapping
   timeout_mapping = {
       "research": 300.0,
       "sme": 120.0,
       "context_provider": 60.0,
   }
   # Fixed missing tracer
   self.tracer = get_tracer()
   ```

2. **`main/src/agents/parallel/sme_agent.py`**
   ```python
   # Fixed array/object parsing order
   if first_char == '[':
       # Check arrays first for array responses
   ```

3. **`main/src/agents/oq_generator/workflow.py`**
   ```python
   # Fixed timeout attribute
   workflow_timeout = getattr(self, 'timeout', 600)
   # Added file saving functionality (by debugger agent)
   async def _save_test_suite_to_file(self, test_suite: OQTestSuite) -> str:
   ```

4. **`main/src/monitoring/simple_tracer.py`**
   ```python
   # Replaced Unicode emojis
   print(f"[API] {service} - {endpoint} - {duration:.2f}s - {'OK' if success else 'FAIL'}")
   ```

### Test Files Created
- `test_sme_api.py` - Verifies SME JSON parsing with real API
- `test_oq_direct_simple.py` - Attempted direct OQ generation (has issues)
- `run_workflow_final.py` - Full workflow runner with monitoring
- `create_sample_oq_output.py` - Creates example output format

### Output Generated
- `output/test_suites/test_suite_OQ_20250803_104400_SAMPLE.json` - Sample showing expected format
- `workflow_output.log` - Full run log showing timeout at OQ generation

## üß™ What Was Tested

### Fully Tested ‚úÖ
1. SME Agent JSON parsing - Confirmed working with real API calls
2. Research Agent timeout - Verified completes FDA calls in ~75s
3. Unicode fixes in simple_tracer - No more crashes from emojis

### Partially Tested ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Full workflow execution - Runs but fails at OQ generation
2. File saving logic - Code added but never reached due to timeout

### Not Tested ‚ùå
1. OQ Generator in isolation - Direct test attempts failed due to API issues
2. Complete end-to-end success - Never achieved full workflow completion
3. Phoenix observability data - Connected but not verified

## üî¨ Key Findings

1. **OQ Generation Timeout Root Cause**
   - The generator makes API calls that timeout
   - Retries 3 times (0.46s, 0.99s, 1.92s delays)
   - Total attempt takes longer than configured timeout
   - May need to increase generation_timeout or reduce complexity

2. **API Key/Configuration Issues**
   - All API keys are loaded correctly
   - OpenAI API works for SME agent
   - Issue appears to be with specific OQ generation prompts

3. **Workflow Progress**
   - Categorization: ~1 second ‚úÖ
   - Context Provider: ~5 seconds ‚úÖ (but finds no docs)
   - Research Agent: ~75 seconds ‚úÖ
   - SME Agent: ~30 seconds ‚úÖ
   - OQ Generator: Timeout after retries ‚ùå

## üöÄ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix OQ Generation Timeout (CRITICAL)
```python
# In OQTestGenerator.__init__
self.generation_timeout = 480  # Increase to 8 minutes

# In workflow configuration
# Reduce test count for initial testing
workflow.default_test_count = 3  # Instead of 15
```

### 2. Debug OQ Generator Prompts
- Add logging to see exact prompts being sent
- Check if prompt is too complex causing timeout
- Test with minimal prompt first

### 3. Fix Remaining Unicode Issues
- Search for all emoji usage: `grep -r "[\U0001f300-\U0001f9ff]" .`
- Replace with ASCII equivalents
- Consider setting `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` globally

### 4. Complete End-to-End Test
- Once OQ timeout fixed, run full workflow
- Verify JSON files are created in `output/test_suites/`
- Validate output format matches sample

### 5. Address SME Regulatory Timeline Issue
- Update validation to accept compound timelines
- Or modify prompt to request single timeline values

## üí° Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with OQ Generator in isolation**
   - Create minimal test that bypasses workflow
   - Use very simple prompt with 1 test only
   - Gradually increase complexity

2. **Add comprehensive logging**
   ```python
   # Before each LLM call
   logger.info(f"Sending prompt ({len(prompt)} chars): {prompt[:200]}...")
   ```

3. **Implement retry with backoff**
   ```python
   from tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt
   
   @retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10), 
          stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
   async def generate_with_retry():
       # LLM call here
   ```

4. **Consider chunking**
   - Generate 5 tests at a time instead of 15
   - Aggregate results

## üìã Environment Details

- **Working Directory**: `C:\Users\anteb\Desktop\Courses\Projects\thesis_project`
- **Python**: Using UV environment
- **APIs**: OpenAI key loaded, FDA APIs accessible
- **Phoenix**: Running on localhost:6006

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Summary

1. **OQ Generator timing out** - Prevents any test output
2. **No fallback allowed** - System fails explicitly (good for compliance, bad for debugging)
3. **Long execution time** - Full workflow takes 6-8 minutes minimum

## üìä Success Metrics

To consider the system working, we need:
1. ‚úÖ Full workflow completes without errors
2. ‚úÖ JSON file created in `output/test_suites/`
3. ‚úÖ File contains valid OQ tests (see sample for format)
4. ‚úÖ All regulatory compliance metadata included
5. ‚úÖ Execution time under 10 minutes

## üéØ Final Goal

Generate a complete OQ test suite JSON file through the full workflow, demonstrating that all agents work together to produce GAMP-5 compliant test documentation.

---

**Note**: The workflow has all the pieces in place but needs the OQ generation timeout issue resolved. Once that's fixed, the system should produce the expected output files.
