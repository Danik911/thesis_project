# Debug Plan: Phoenix Observability Critical Failures

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on systematic investigation, the Phoenix observability system has **critical infrastructure failures** despite appearing functional on the surface:

### Primary Issues Identified:
1. **GraphQL API Complete Failure**: Phoenix server running but GraphQL queries fail with "unexpected error occurred"
2. **Environment Misalignment**: Phoenix potentially installed in anaconda3, Python running from different location
3. **NumPy 2.x Dependency Conflicts**: Breaking Phoenix dependencies
4. **Trace Export Pipeline Broken**: Traces generated but not reaching Phoenix properly
5. **Enhanced Features Dead Code**: Run after workflow completion but workflows fail before triggering

### Evidence:
- Phoenix server responds (HTTP 200, version 11.13.2)
- GraphQL schema accessible but data queries fail
- OTLP endpoint accessible (415 expected for GET)
- Diagnostic shows "NoneType is not iterable" for trace data access
- Dashboard generates but contains empty data arrays

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Environment Alignment Fix
**Objective**: Ensure Python environment consistency

```bash
# Check current Python/Phoenix setup
uv run python -c "import phoenix; print(phoenix.__file__)"
uv run python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

# Reinstall Phoenix in correct environment
uv add arize-phoenix
uv add opentelemetry-instrumentation-llama-index
uv add openinference-instrumentation-openai
```

### Step 2: NumPy Dependency Resolution
**Objective**: Fix NumPy 2.x compatibility issues

```bash
# Force compatible NumPy version
uv add "numpy<2.0" --resolution=highest
uv sync
```

### Step 3: GraphQL API Debug and Repair
**Objective**: Fix GraphQL data access failures

Create diagnostic script to test:
- Basic GraphQL connectivity
- Schema introspection
- Simple data queries
- Phoenix internal state

### Step 4: OTLP Export Pipeline Verification
**Objective**: Ensure traces reach Phoenix correctly

Test:
- Manual trace generation
- OTLP exporter configuration
- Batch span processor settings
- Phoenix trace ingestion

### Step 5: Enhanced Features Architecture Fix
**Objective**: Move enhanced observability to run DURING workflow, not after

Change from:
```python
# Current: runs after workflow (never executes)
finally:
    if self.enable_phoenix:
        enhanced_analysis()
```

To:
```python
# Fixed: runs during workflow steps
@step
async def some_workflow_step(self, ctx, ev):
    result = await process_step(ev)
    if self.enable_phoenix:
        await capture_enhanced_metrics(result)
    return result
```

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Changes**:
- Environment alignment
- NumPy version fix
- Basic diagnostic scripts

**Medium Risk Changes**:
- OTLP configuration adjustments
- GraphQL query fixes

**High Risk Changes**:
- Enhanced observability architecture changes
- Workflow instrumentation modifications

## Compliance Validation

**GAMP-5 Implications**:
- Observability system must provide complete audit trail
- Cannot mask failures with fallback logic
- All trace data must be accessible for regulatory review

**21 CFR Part 11 Requirements**:
- Electronic records must be retrievable
- System must maintain data integrity
- Access controls must be auditable

## ðŸš€ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**To fix ALL Phoenix observability issues, run:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\anteb\Desktop\Courses\Projects\thesis_project
python master_phoenix_fix.py
```

This will automatically:
1. Fix environment and dependency issues
2. Repair GraphQL API problems
3. Run comprehensive diagnostics
4. Validate end-to-end functionality
5. Generate complete fix report

**Individual script usage:**
```bash
# Fix environment only
python fix_phoenix_environment.py

# Fix GraphQL API only  
python fix_phoenix_graphql.py

# Run full diagnostic
python main/debug_phoenix_comprehensive.py

# Test end-to-end functionality
python test_phoenix_end_to_end.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- Phoenix server running at http://localhost:6006
- GraphQL API returning trace data successfully
- All workflow traces captured and retrievable
- Enhanced pharmaceutical compliance features working
- Dashboard showing populated data arrays

## Escalation Plan

If master fix script fails:
1. Review generated fix report JSON files
2. Run individual scripts to isolate issues
3. Check Phoenix server logs manually
4. Consider Phoenix Docker containerization
5. Evaluate alternative observability platforms
