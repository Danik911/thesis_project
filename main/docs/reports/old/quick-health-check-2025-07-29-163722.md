# Quick Health Check Report
**Date**: 2025-07-29 16:37:22
**Tester**: end-to-end-tester subagent
**Status**: ❌ FAIL

## Executive Summary
Critical system failures identified in pharmaceutical test generation workflow. While basic execution completes, core production features are non-functional.

## Critical Issues
- **Zero confidence scoring** (0.0% despite successful categorization)
- **Zero event logging** (0 events captured in extensive workflow)
- **Zero audit trail** (compliance violation)
- **Phoenix observability broken** (no trace data collection)
- **Parallel agents not integrated** (coordination requests only)

## Health Check Results
```
✅ Phoenix Docker running
✅ Phoenix UI accessible  
✅ OpenAI available
✅ Test document created
❌ Event logging (0 events captured)
❌ Confidence scoring (0.0% reported)
❌ Phoenix traces (no API access)
❌ Parallel execution (not integrated)
❌ Audit compliance (0 entries)
```

## Performance
- **Execution Time**: 18.763 seconds
- **Workflow Status**: Completed with critical errors
- **Agent Coordination**: Partial (planning only)

## Verdict
**SYSTEM NOT PRODUCTION READY** - Multiple critical failures prevent deployment.

**Priority 1 Fixes Required**:
1. Fix confidence scoring system
2. Repair event logging capture
3. Enable Phoenix trace collection
4. Implement actual parallel agent execution
