## Preface

This second edition of the ISPE Baseline® Guide: Commissioning and Qualification provides practical guidance to industry on the implementation of a science and risk-based approach to commissioning and qualifying pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment to demonstrate that they are suitable for the intended purpose.

This Guide intends to offer a compliant, integrated science and risk-based approach to make the commissioning and qualification process efficient and cost-effective. It is intended to align with regulatory guidances, including EU GMP Annex 15 Qualification and Validation (October 2015) [1], US FDA Guidance for Industry: Process Validation (January 2011) [2], and ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management (November 2005) [3].

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

It is a universal regulatory expectation that pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment are designed, constructed and qualified to be suitable for the intended purpose. Regulatory authorities have indicated in their guidances and regulations that organizations must build quality into their processes and products.

This Guide intends to offer a compliant, integrated commissioning and qualification process that is based on a science and risk-based approach. This process supports Quality by Design and ensures that risks to product quality from the systems are adequately addressed.

Commissioning and qualification differ only in that the qualification process has oversight by the Quality Unit, focused on the system risk to product quality. The Quality Unit ultimately decides whether systems are suitable for the intended purpose, based on the identification, testing, and documentation of the system features deemed critical to product quality.

### 1.2 Purpose and Objectives

This Guide intends to offer a compliant, integrated C&Q approach to making the qualification process efficient and cost-effective. The approach includes a System Risk Assessment process that identifies the Critical Aspects (CAs) and/or Critical Design Elements (CDEs). CDEs are system functions and features identified as having the potential to control risks to product quality and therefore ensure patient safety.

This Guide recognizes industry best practices regarding C&Q and presents concepts that can assist organizations in meeting current regulatory expectations for system qualification by:

- Providing guidance on how to apply the Quality Risk Management (QRM) process to C&Q to establish CDEs
- Defining the focus of an integrated C&Q effort to be the CAs/CDEs and Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) which provide the ability to deliver the product Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)
- Defining best practices for User Requirements Specification (URS), Design Review (DR), Design Qualification (DQ), and acceptance and release of the system
- Clarifying the change management processes required to support the C&Q process
- Providing Good Engineering Practice (GEP) documentation standards
- Describing where testing should be duplicated and where it is acceptable to test once

### 1.3 Scope

This Guide applies to systems used by pharmaceutical manufacturers of human and veterinary drugs, including biological drug products. Medical devices have separate regulatory requirements and are outside of the scope of this Guide.

The following areas are not in the scope of the C&Q process as described in this Guide:
- Product and process development, including identification of any process requirements that influence system design
- Computerized systems software development and testing (refer to ISPE GAMP® 5)
- Process validation, including Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) and Continued/Ongoing Process Verification

## 1.7 Key Terms and Definitions

### Critical Aspects (CAs)
As defined in ASTM E2500-13: "Functions, features, abilities, and performance or characteristics necessary for the manufacturing process and systems to ensure consistent product quality and patient safety."

### Critical Design Elements (CDEs)
Design functions or features of an engineered system that are necessary to consistently manufacture products with the desired quality attributes. CDEs are identified and documented based on technical understanding of the product CQAs, process CPPs, and equipment design/automation. CDEs are verified through C&Q.

### Critical Process Parameter (CPP)
As defined in ICH Q8: "A process parameter whose variability has an impact on a critical quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces the desired quality."

### Critical Quality Attribute (CQA)
As defined in ICH Q8: "A physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or distribution to ensure the desired product quality."

### Design Qualification (DQ)
A documented process that verifies the proposed design of the facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment is suitable for the intended purpose.

### Design Review (DR)
As defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765: "Formal, documented, comprehensive, and systematic examination of a design to determine if the design meets the applicable requirements, to identify problems, and to propose solutions."

### Direct Impact System
A system that directly impacts product CQAs, or directly impacts the quality of the product delivered by a critical utility system. All other systems are considered to be not direct impact.

### Installation Qualification (IQ)
A documented process that verifies that the facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment, as installed or modified, comply with the approved design and the manufacturer's recommendations.

### Operational Qualification (OQ)
A documented process that verifies that the facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment, as installed or modified, perform as intended throughout the anticipated operating ranges.

### Performance Qualification (PQ)
A documented process that verifies that the facilities, systems, utilities, and equipment, as connected together, can perform effectively and reproducibly, based on the approved process method and product specification.

### Quality Risk Management (QRM)
As defined in ICH Q9: "A systematic process for the assessment, control, communication and review of risks to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product across the product lifecycle."

### Suitable for the Intended Purpose
The system requirements are defined, the design is appropriate for control of the manufacturing process, and the system is fabricated and installed as designed, and performs as intended throughout the anticipated operating ranges.

## 2. User Requirements Specification

The User Requirements Specification (URS) is a document that defines the requirements for the system in terms of product to be manufactured, required throughput and conditions in which the product should be made. The URS serves as the foundation for all subsequent C&Q activities.

### 2.2 Development of the User Requirements Specification

The URS should be developed early in the project lifecycle and should include:
- Product requirements and specifications
- Process requirements and parameters
- Quality requirements and standards
- Regulatory requirements and compliance needs
- Environmental and safety requirements
- Maintenance and operational requirements

## 3. System Classification

### 3.1 Introduction

System classification is a fundamental step in the C&Q process that determines the appropriate level of qualification effort based on the system's potential impact on product quality and patient safety.

### 3.3 Criteria for System Classification

Systems are classified as either:
- **Direct Impact Systems**: Systems that directly impact product CQAs or directly impact the quality of the product delivered by a critical utility system
- **Not Direct Impact Systems**: All other systems that do not directly impact product quality

The classification determines the level of qualification rigor required, with direct impact systems requiring more comprehensive qualification activities.

## 4. System Risk Assessment

### 4.1 Introduction

The System Risk Assessment is a systematic process for identifying, evaluating, and controlling risks to product quality that may arise from system design, installation, or operation. This process is fundamental to the science and risk-based approach to C&Q.
