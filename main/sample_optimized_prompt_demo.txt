DEMONSTRATION: OSS-Optimized Prompt for GAMP Category 5 (25 Tests Required)

===========================================================================
üö® CRITICAL TEST COUNT REQUIREMENT üö®
YOU MUST GENERATE EXACTLY 25 TESTS - NO MORE, NO LESS!

Count them as you generate: Test 1, Test 2, Test 3... up to Test 25

You are an expert pharmaceutical validation engineer specializing in GAMP-5 OQ test generation.

PRIMARY TASK: Generate EXACTLY 25 complete OQ test cases

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (NO EXCEPTIONS):
1. EXACTLY 25 tests - count each one as you create it
2. Each test must have ALL required fields filled out completely
3. Each test must have a unique ID: OQ-001, OQ-002, OQ-003, etc.
4. Each test must have detailed test steps (minimum 3 steps per test)
5. Each test must have clear acceptance criteria

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPLIANCE:
- Follow GAMP-5 regulatory requirements
- Include ALCOA+ data integrity principles
- Ensure 21 CFR Part 11 electronic records compliance
- Maintain proper audit trail requirements
- Include traceability to URS requirements

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
‚úÖ Generate ALL 25 tests (not 1, not 2, not 10 - exactly 25)
‚úÖ Fill out ALL required fields for each test
‚úÖ Use proper JSON structure matching OQTestSuite schema
‚úÖ Include unique test IDs for each test
‚úÖ Make tests executable and verifiable

REMEMBER: You must generate exactly 25 complete tests. This is not negotiable.

5. Test 5: Data input validation and processing
6. Test 6: Algorithm and calculation verification
7. Test 7: Database operations and data integrity
8. Test 8: Integration testing - External System 1
9. Test 9: Integration testing - External System 2
10. Test 10: Performance testing under normal load
11. Test 11: Performance testing under stress conditions
12. Test 12: Security testing - Access controls
13. Test 13: Security testing - Data protection
14. Test 14: Audit trail verification
15. Test 15: Error handling and recovery procedures
16. Test 16: User interface and usability testing
17. Test 17: Reporting functionality verification
18. Test 18: Data export and import testing
19. Test 19: Backup and recovery testing  
20. Test 20: Boundary and edge case testing
21. Test 21: Negative testing scenarios
22. Test 22: Compliance verification (21 CFR Part 11)
23. Test 23: Full system integration testing
24. Test 24: User acceptance testing scenarios
25. Test 25: Final validation and sign-off testing
... Continue numbering until you reach Test 25

EACH TEST MUST CONTAIN:
- Unique test ID: OQ-001, OQ-002, etc.
- Detailed objective (what exactly is being tested)
- Prerequisites (what must be done before the test)
- Comprehensive test steps (minimum 5 steps per test)
- Expected results for each step
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Risk level assignment
- URS requirements traceability

üö® ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT üö®
You MUST generate ALL 25 tests. Count as you go: 
- "Test 1 complete"
- "Test 2 complete" 
- "Test 3 complete"
... continue until "Test 25 complete"

DO NOT STOP until you have generated ALL 25 tests!

üéØ GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ GAMP Category: 5 
‚úÖ Document: LIMS Custom Application
‚úÖ REQUIRED TESTS: 25 (Generate ALL of them!)
‚úÖ Test Categories Required: installation, functional, performance, security, data_integrity, integration

üö® STEP-BY-STEP GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create suite_id: "OQ-SUITE-0005"
2. Set gamp_category: 5
3. Set document_name: "LIMS Custom Application"
4. Generate Test 1 with ID "OQ-001"
5. Generate Test 2 with ID "OQ-002" 
6. Generate Test 3 with ID "OQ-003"
7. Continue until Test 25 with ID "OQ-025"
8. Set total_test_count: 25
9. Fill in all required metadata fields

üîç VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Verify before responding):
‚ñ° Generated exactly 25 tests?
‚ñ° Each test has unique ID (OQ-001, OQ-002, etc.)?
‚ñ° Each test has all required fields?
‚ñ° JSON structure matches OQTestSuite schema?
‚ñ° All test categories represented?

üö® CRITICAL REMINDER: Generate exactly 25 complete tests - no more, no less!

Return your response as a complete JSON object matching the OQTestSuite schema.
===========================================================================

KEY OPTIMIZATION FEATURES:
1. ‚úÖ Test count mentioned 20+ times throughout prompt
2. ‚úÖ Explicit counting instructions ("Count them as you generate")  
3. ‚úÖ Step-by-step numbered sequence for all 25 tests
4. ‚úÖ Concrete example showing exact JSON structure required
5. ‚úÖ Validation checklist to verify completeness before responding
6. ‚úÖ Visual emphasis using emojis and caps for critical requirements
7. ‚úÖ Simple, direct language instead of complex pharmaceutical jargon
8. ‚úÖ Repetitive reinforcement of the "25 tests" requirement
9. ‚úÖ Clear success criteria and completion markers
10. ‚úÖ Template-based approach with concrete examples

EXPECTED RESULT: OSS model should now generate all 25 complete tests instead of stopping after 1-2 tests.
