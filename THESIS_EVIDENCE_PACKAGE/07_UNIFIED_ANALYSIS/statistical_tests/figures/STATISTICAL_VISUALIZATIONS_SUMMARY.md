## Key Visual Insights

1. **Statistical Power**: Visualizations clearly show the study is underpowered, requiring 7x more samples
2. **Effect Sizes**: Mixed results with small Cohen's d but large Cramér's V and η²
3. **Bootstrap Confidence**: Wide confidence intervals reflect small sample size
4. **Quality Metrics**: High test uniqueness (87%) and clear criteria (92%) demonstrated
5. **Cost Benefit**: Despite statistical limitations, practical significance is strong
