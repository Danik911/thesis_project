## Section 10: Limitations & Recommendations

### 10.1 Statistical Limitations

1. **Sample Size (n=30)**
   - Power of 18.02% is severely inadequate
   - Cannot detect small to medium effects reliably
   - Confidence intervals are wide

2. **Distribution Violations**
   - Costs and test counts violate normality
   - Required non-parametric alternatives
   - Some precision lost in analysis

3. **Multiple Comparisons**
   - 5 primary hypotheses tested
   - Bonferroni correction eliminates most significance
   - FDR approach more appropriate for exploratory work

4. **Corpus Imbalance**
   - C1: 17 documents, C2: 8 documents, C3: 5 documents
   - Unequal sample sizes affect comparison power
   - Weighted analyses may be needed

### 10.2 Recommendations for Thesis

**Immediate Actions**
1. Acknowledge power limitations explicitly in limitations section
2. Frame results as "pilot study" or "proof of concept"
3. Emphasize practical significance over statistical significance
4. Focus on the 99.98% cost reduction as primary outcome

**Statistical Reporting**
1. Report all effect sizes alongside p-values
2. Use confidence intervals throughout
3. Include bootstrap results for robustness
4. Acknowledge Type II error risk

**Future Research**
1. Calculate required sample size for 80% power (n=206)
2. Design stratified sampling for balanced corpuses
3. Implement sequential analysis for early stopping
4. Consider Bayesian approaches for small samples

### 10.3 Strengths to Emphasize

Despite power limitations, the study demonstrates:
- **Exceptional cost efficiency**: 99.98% reduction
- **High accuracy when successful**: 91.3% categorization
- **Strong improvement trend**: r=0.986 over corpuses
- **Comprehensive test generation**: 316 high-quality tests
- **Robust error recovery**: 85.7% recovery rate

### 10.4 Thesis Defense Preparation

**Anticipated Questions & Responses**

Q: "Why didn't you achieve 80% power?"
A: "This pilot study established feasibility. The 206 documents needed for 80% power would require 6+ months of additional data collection, beyond thesis scope."

Q: "Are your results statistically significant?"
A: "While some tests don't reach traditional significance due to limited power, the practical significance is undeniable with 99.98% cost reduction and 91.3% accuracy."

Q: "How do you justify conclusions with 18% power?"
A: "We report effect sizes and confidence intervals, acknowledge limitations explicitly, and focus on practical/clinical significance alongside statistical metrics."
