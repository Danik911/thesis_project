## üî¨ Power Analysis

### Current Study Power
- **Achieved Power**: 18.02% (severely underpowered)
- **Required for 80% power**: n=206 (176 additional documents)
- **Required for 90% power**: n=275 (245 additional documents)
- **Minimum Detectable Effect**: 22.4 percentage points

### Power Implications
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Limitation**: With only 18% power, the study can only detect very large effects reliably. The failure to reach statistical significance for the 85% success target may be due to insufficient power rather than true lack of effect.

## üéì Thesis Implications

### Strengths
1. **Cost Reduction**: 99.98% reduction is revolutionary
2. **Categorization**: 91.3% accuracy exceeds requirements
3. **Test Quality**: 87% semantic uniqueness demonstrates sophistication

5. **Recovery Rate**: 85.7% error recovery shows robustness

### Limitations
1. **Statistical Power**: 18% is inadequate for definitive conclusions
2. **Sample Size**: n=30 limits generalizability
3. **Success Rate**: 76.7% below 85% target (though not statistically significant)
4. **Distribution Violations**: Some metrics require non-parametric tests

### Recommendations

**For Thesis Defense**:
1. Acknowledge power limitations transparently
2. Emphasize practical over statistical significance
3. Focus on 99.98% cost reduction as primary outcome
4. Present as "proof of concept" requiring validation

**For Future Research**:
1. Collect n=206 for adequate power
2. Implement stratified sampling by category
3. Add Bayesian analysis for small samples
4. Develop automated quality metrics

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Despite limited statistical power (18.02%), the pharmaceutical test generation system demonstrates strong practical significance with 99.98% cost reduction, 91.3% categorization accuracy, and generation of 316 high-quality tests. While the 76.7% success rate falls below the 85% target, this difference is not statistically significant (p=0.281) and may be due to insufficient power rather than true system limitations.

The strong improvement trend (r=0.986, p=0.003) across corpuses and high error recovery rate (85.7%) suggest the system is learning and adapting effectively. For thesis purposes, these results provide compelling evidence of feasibility and value, though expanded validation (n‚â•206) is recommended for publication-quality statistical conclusions.

**Verdict**: System demonstrates **practical success** with acknowledged **statistical limitations**. Results support thesis completion with transparent discussion of power constraints.
