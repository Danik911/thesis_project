## 2. STATISTICAL CONFIDENCE ANALYSIS

### Sample Size and Power
- **Sample Size:** n=30 documents
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Margin of Error:** ±8.3%
- **Statistical Power:** 0.50 (inadequate for detecting small effects)
- **Required for 80% Power:** n=114 documents
- **Required for 90% Power:** n=148 documents

### Interpretation
The current sample size is adequate for initial validation and proof-of-concept but insufficient for production-level confidence. The 50% statistical power means there's only a 50% chance of detecting true differences from expected performance levels.
