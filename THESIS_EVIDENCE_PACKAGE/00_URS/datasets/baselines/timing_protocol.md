- Create standardized measurement procedures for consistent timing across reviewers
- Generate benchmark data for evaluating LLM-driven automation performance
- Document variability in manual effort across different URS complexity levels

### Secondary Objectives
- Identify common challenges in manual test generation process
- Document quality metrics for manually generated test cases
- Establish reviewer experience impact on timing and quality
- Create standardized deliverables template for test generation

## Measurement Procedures

### Timing Methodology

#### Time Tracking Rules

1. **Start/Stop Timing**
   - Start timing when beginning to read the URS document
   - Stop timing when all deliverables are complete and reviewed
   - Record actual elapsed time, not calendar time

2. **Interruption Handling**
   - Pause timer for interruptions exceeding 15 minutes
   - Log interruption reason and duration
   - Resume timing when returning to task
   - Record net active work time

3. **Break Management**
   - Scheduled breaks (lunch, coffee) - pause timer
   - Unscheduled breaks exceeding 10 minutes - pause timer
   - Short breaks (5-10 minutes) - continue timing
   - Document break patterns for analysis

#### Activity Time Breakdown

Track time for each major activity:

- **Requirements Analysis**: Time spent reading and analyzing URS
- **Test Design**: Time spent creating test case concepts and scenarios
- **Documentation**: Time spent writing detailed test procedures
- **Review**: Time spent on self-review and quality assurance
- **Rework**: Time spent correcting identified issues
