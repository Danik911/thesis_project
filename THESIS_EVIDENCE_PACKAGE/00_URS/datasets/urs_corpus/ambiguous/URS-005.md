# URS-005: Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)
**GAMP Category**: Ambiguous (4/5)
**System Type**: Hybrid Cloud-Based Trial Management Platform
**Domain**: Clinical Operations
**Complexity Level**: High

## 1. Introduction
This URS defines requirements for a CTMS to manage global clinical trials with both standard and specialized adaptive trial designs.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-001**: Base system shall use commercial Veeva CTMS platform.
- **URS-CTMS-002**: Standard modules to be configured:
  - Site management
  - Patient enrollment tracking
  - Monitoring visit planning
  - Standard financial management
- **URS-CTMS-003**: Develop custom modules for:
  - Proprietary adaptive trial design algorithms
  - Integration with in-house randomization system
  - Custom safety signal detection beyond platform capabilities
- **URS-CTMS-004**: Configure workflow approvals using platform tools.
- **URS-CTMS-005**: Implement extensive custom APIs for:
  - Real-time data exchange with wearable devices
  - Integration with AI-based image analysis systems
  - Connection to proprietary biomarker databases
- **URS-CTMS-006**: Develop custom dashboards with advanced visualizations not available in base product.
- **URS-CTMS-007**: Create specialized reports combining CTMS data with external real-world evidence.

## 3. Ambiguous Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-008**: System shall support "innovative" trial designs (Note: unclear if configuration or custom development required).
- **URS-CTMS-009**: Implement "sophisticated" risk-based monitoring algorithms.
- **URS-CTMS-010**: System shall provide "enhanced" regulatory compliance tracking beyond standard GCP.
- **URS-CTMS-011**: Enable "advanced" machine learning capabilities for patient recruitment optimization.

## 4. Technical Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-012**: Hybrid deployment with some modules on-premise due to data sovereignty.
- **URS-CTMS-013**: Custom encryption beyond platform standards for certain jurisdictions.

## 5. Regulatory Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-014**: System shall comply with GCP requirements across all global jurisdictions.
- **URS-CTMS-015**: Maintain complete audit trail for all clinical trial activities per 21 CFR Part 11.
- **URS-CTMS-016**: Support electronic signatures for protocol deviations and regulatory submissions.
- **URS-CTMS-017**: Ensure data privacy compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and local regulations.
- **URS-CTMS-018**: Generate regulatory inspection readiness packages automatically.

## 6. Performance Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-019**: System shall support 10,000 active trial participants simultaneously.
- **URS-CTMS-020**: Real-time dashboard updates within 5 minutes of data changes.
- **URS-CTMS-021**: Complex trial reports shall generate within 30 minutes.

## 7. Integration Requirements
- **URS-CTMS-022**: Custom API development for regulatory authority submissions.
- **URS-CTMS-023**: Integration with global patient recruitment platforms.
- **URS-CTMS-024**: Real-time synchronization with electronic data capture systems.
