# URS-030: Legacy System Migration (Mainframe to Cloud)
**GAMP Category**: Special Case (Migration)
**System Type**: Data and application migration with validation and cutover planning
**Domain**: Enterprise IT / Quality Systems
**Complexity Level**: High

## 1. Introduction
Migrate a validated mainframe-based quality records system to a modern cloud platform while preserving data integrity, audit trails, and validated state. The project leverages automated migration tooling, staged verification, and risk-based validation.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- URS-030-001: Extract, transform, and load legacy records with checksum verification.
- URS-030-002: Migrate user accounts, roles, and historical permissions.
- URS-030-003: Reconstruct and preserve audit trails with immutable storage.
- URS-030-004: Provide parallel run mode with reconciliation reporting.
- URS-030-005: Implement freeze, cutover, and rollback procedures with approvals.
- URS-030-006: Validate migrated reports and calculations against reference outputs.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-030-007: Ensure chain-of-custody for data during migration.
- URS-030-008: Maintain ALCOA+ attributes across extraction, staging, and load.
- URS-030-009: Validate equivalence of functionality post-migration.
- URS-030-010: Maintain 21 CFR Part 11 compliance including e-signatures.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-030-011: Migrate 50M records within a 48-hour cutover window.
- URS-030-012: Reconciliation shall demonstrate â‰¥ 99.99% data match.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-030-013: Integrate with enterprise identity provider and archival systems.
- URS-030-014: Provide APIs for downstream systems consuming migrated data.

## 6. Technical Architecture Requirements
- URS-030-015: Use immutable object storage for audit trails.
- URS-030-016: Implement zero-downtime deployment pattern with blue/green.
- URS-030-017: Cryptographically sign migration manifests and logs.
