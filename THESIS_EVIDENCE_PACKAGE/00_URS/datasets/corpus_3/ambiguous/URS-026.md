# URS-026: Pharmaceutical Data Analytics Platform
**GAMP Category**: Ambiguous (3/4)
**System Type**: Commercial analytics platform with configured compliance content
**Domain**: Enterprise Quality and Operations Analytics
**Complexity Level**: Medium

## 1. Introduction
A pharmaceutical analytics platform will be implemented using vendor-supplied, commercial off-the-shelf capabilities with configured dashboards, governed data models, and role-based access. Some customers may also enable vendor scripting and configuration tools to implement business rules, alerts, and KPI thresholds for GxP-relevant metrics.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- URS-026-001: Users shall access pre-built dashboards for deviations, CAPA, batch yield, OEE, and complaints using vendor templates.
- URS-026-002: The system shall allow configuration of KPI thresholds and alert rules using vendor tools.
- URS-026-003: The platform shall provide governed, read-only semantic layers for GxP datasets.
- URS-026-004: Users shall schedule standard reports and subscriptions using vendor scheduler.
- URS-026-005: The system shall enforce row-level security using configured roles.
- URS-026-006: The platform shall provide lineage views leveraging vendor catalog features.
- URS-026-007: The platform shall support vendor-standard data quality checks configurable per dataset.
- URS-026-008: The platform shall provide drill-through to source record keys without write-back.
- URS-026-009: The platform shall provide governed export to CSV/PDF using vendor export features.
- URS-026-010: The platform shall allow calculated fields using vendor formula language.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-026-011: Access to GxP semantic layers shall be read-only for end-users.
- URS-026-012: Changes to governed models shall be approved via change control.
- URS-026-013: Audit trail shall capture changes to dashboards, alerts, and roles.
- URS-026-014: The platform shall enable retention policies for governed content.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-026-015: Dashboards shall load within 5 seconds for 50M-row datasets under normal load.
- URS-026-016: Scheduled report generation shall complete within 10 minutes for enterprise distributions.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-026-017: Support standard connectors (ODBC/JDBC, REST) to LIMS, MES, ERP, and QMS.
- URS-026-018: Integrate with SSO (SAML/OIDC) and AD groups for role mapping.
