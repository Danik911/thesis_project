## 4.7 Limitations and Future Work

### 4.7.1 Current System Limitations

#### 4.7.1.1 Cost Model Inaccuracy (CRITICAL LIMITATION)

The most significant limitation identified is the fundamental inaccuracy of the cost prediction model, with actual costs exceeding targets by a factor of 25.2x.

**Quantified Cost Analysis:**
- **Target Cost per Document:** $0.00056
- **Actual Cost per Document:** $0.014118
- **Cost Variance:** 2,421% over target (25.2x factor)
- **Financial Impact at Scale:** $13,658 additional cost per 1,000 documents
- **Root Cause:** Token consumption patterns not accurately modeled in initial projections

**Technical Analysis of Cost Drivers:**
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Overhead:** Complex workflow coordination requires additional API calls
2. **GAMP-5 Compliance Requirements:** Regulatory validation steps increase token consumption by ~200%
3. **Quality Assurance Iterations:** Multiple validation passes contribute 15-20% of total cost
4. **Context Window Utilization:** Full document processing requires larger context windows than anticipated

**Production Deployment Impact:**
The 25.2x cost overrun presents a significant barrier to production deployment in pharmaceutical environments where cost predictability is critical for regulatory approval. This limitation requires immediate attention before any scaled implementation.

**Regulatory Implications:**
Under GAMP-5 economic validation requirements, cost predictions must achieve ±10% accuracy for regulatory approval. The current 2,421% variance would result in automatic validation failure and system rejection in pharmaceutical environments.

#### 4.7.1.2 Statistical Power Inadequacy (CRITICAL LIMITATION)

The experimental validation suffers from insufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences in several key analyses.

**Power Analysis Results:**
- **Current Statistical Power:** 0.05 (dual-mode comparison)
- **Required Statistical Power:** 0.8 (industry standard)
- **Power Deficit:** 93.75% shortfall
- **Sample Size Required:** 64 observations per group (current: 4 per group)
- **Total Documents Needed:** 218 minimum (current: 17 total)

**Specific Power Limitations:**
```
Statistical Test Power Assessment:
- Cost Reduction Test: >99% power ✅
- ROI Analysis: >99% power ✅
- Efficiency Test: >99% power ✅
- Dual-Mode Comparison: 5.1% power ❌ (Critical failure)
- GAMP ANOVA: <20% power ❌ (Insufficient)
```

**Research Validity Impact:**
The low statistical power for comparative analyses undermines the reliability of conclusions drawn from operational mode comparisons and GAMP category performance differences. This limits the generalizability of findings and creates risk for false negative results.

**Pharmaceutical Validation Standards:**
FDA guidelines for computerized system validation require statistical power ≥0.8 for all performance comparisons. The current 0.05 power level falls far below acceptable standards for regulatory submission.

#### 4.7.1.3 Sample Size Constraints (HIGH LIMITATION)

The validation dataset of 17 documents represents a fundamental constraint limiting the generalizability and statistical reliability of findings.

**Sample Size Analysis:**
- **Current Sample Size:** 17 pharmaceutical documents
- **Industry Minimum Recommended:** 100+ documents for pharmaceutical AI validation
- **Statistical Adequacy:** 15.3% shortfall from minimum recommended
- **Coverage by Document Type:**
  - Installation Qualification (IQ): 6 documents
  - Operational Qualification (OQ): 7 documents  
  - Performance Qualification (PQ): 4 documents

**Generalizability Constraints:**
The limited sample size restricts conclusions to the specific document types and pharmaceutical contexts included in the validation set. Broader pharmaceutical industry applicability remains unvalidated due to insufficient representation across:
- Different pharmaceutical manufacturing environments
- Varying GAMP-5 category distributions
- Multiple regulatory jurisdiction requirements (FDA, EMA, Health Canada, etc.)

**Statistical Reliability Impact:**
Bootstrap confidence intervals, while providing robust estimation within the available data, cannot overcome the fundamental limitation of insufficient sample diversity. The narrow confidence intervals may provide false precision due to sampling bias.

#### 4.7.1.4 Requirements Coverage Gap (MEDIUM LIMITATION)

System performance achieved 88.24% requirements coverage against a 90% target, representing a consistent 1.76 percentage point shortfall.

**Coverage Analysis by Category:**
- **Overall Coverage:** 88.24% (target: 90%)
- **Gap Magnitude:** 1.76 percentage points (1.95% relative shortfall)
- **Requirements Missed:** Approximately 9-10 requirements out of 510 total
- **Statistical Significance:** Gap not statistically significant (p = 0.127)

**Performance by Document Type:**
```
Requirements Coverage Distribution:
- IQ Documents: 92.1% (exceeds target) ✅
- OQ Documents: 89.7% (approaches target) 🟡
- PQ Documents: 83.8% (below target) ❌
```

**Technical Root Causes:**
1. **PQ Document Complexity:** Performance qualification requirements show highest complexity
2. **Edge Case Scenarios:** Uncommon operational procedures not well-represented in training
3. **GAMP-5 Category 5 Challenges:** Custom software validation requirements most difficult to address

**Production Impact:**
While the 1.8% coverage gap may appear minimal, pharmaceutical validation requires comprehensive coverage for regulatory approval. Missing requirements could result in validation failures during FDA inspection or regulatory review.

#### 4.7.1.5 ROI Calculation Discrepancies (MEDIUM LIMITATION)

Multiple ROI calculation methodologies produced significantly different results, indicating methodological inconsistencies requiring resolution.

**ROI Calculation Variance:**
- **Primary Calculation:** 7,407,307.4% (performance analysis)
- **Alternative Calculation:** 535,714,185.7% (Task 29 visualization data)
- **Discrepancy Factor:** 72.3x difference between methods
- **Baseline Comparison Issues:** Inconsistent manual cost assumptions

**Methodological Inconsistencies:**
1. **Manual Cost Assumptions:** Varying estimates of traditional manual testing costs
2. **Time Value Calculations:** Different approaches to hourly rate assumptions
3. **Overhead Inclusion:** Inconsistent treatment of infrastructure and compliance costs
4. **Scaling Assumptions:** Linear vs. exponential cost scaling models

**Business Case Impact:**
ROI calculation discrepancies of this magnitude create uncertainty for business case validation in pharmaceutical environments where financial projections must be accurate within ±5% for regulatory and corporate approval processes.

#### 4.7.1.6 Single Model Dependency (HIGH LIMITATION)

The validation is limited to DeepSeek V3, creating vendor lock-in risk and limiting generalizability across different LLM architectures.

**Model Dependency Analysis:**
- **Primary Model:** DeepSeek V3 (671B MoE) exclusively
- **Alternative Models Tested:** None
- **Vendor Diversification:** 0% (complete dependency)
- **Performance Generalization:** Unknown across model families

**Risk Assessment:**
1. **Vendor Lock-in Risk:** Complete dependency on single API provider
2. **Performance Variability:** Unknown performance across model architectures  
3. **Cost Optimization:** No comparative cost analysis across providers
4. **Regulatory Risk:** Single-source validation may not meet pharmaceutical supplier diversity requirements

**Pharmaceutical Industry Standards:**
GAMP-5 supplier assessment guidelines recommend multi-vendor validation for critical pharmaceutical systems to ensure supply chain resilience and performance consistency.
