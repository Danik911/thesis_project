# Chapter 2 - Literature Review: From Traditional CSV to AI-Enabled Validation

## 2.1 Methodology: Literature Search and Selection Strategy

This literature review synthesizes research at the intersection of pharmaceutical Computer System Validation (CSV), Computer Software Assurance (CSA), and Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. The search strategy systematically addressed three converging domains: the regulatory evolution from CSV to CSA in pharmaceutical contexts; technical capabilities and limitations of LLMs in software testing and validation; and empirical evidence of AI adoption within regulated pharmaceutical environments. Through this synthesis, the review establishes the theoretical and practical foundations for understanding how LLM technologies might transform pharmaceutical validation practices while maintaining regulatory compliance and patient safety.

### Database Selection and Search Protocol

The search covered seven primary databases: PubMed/MEDLINE for biomedical literature, IEEE Xplore for technical implementations, Web of Science for cross-disciplinary research, ScienceDirect for pharmaceutical sciences, arXiv for emerging AI research, regulatory databases (FDA, EMA, ICH) for guidance documents, and industry repositories (ISPE, PDA) for practical guidelines. This multi-database approach ensured comprehensive coverage across regulatory, technical, and practical dimensions.

The search strategy employed a Boolean combination of three concept clusters designed to capture the intersection of pharmaceutical validation and AI technologies:

**Cluster A (Pharmaceutical Validation Context):**
("computer system* validation" OR "CSV" OR "computer software assurance" OR "CSA" OR "GAMP 5" OR "GAMP5") AND ("pharmaceutical*" OR "pharma" OR "GxP" OR "21 CFR Part 11" OR "Annex 11" OR "data integrity" OR "ALCOA+")

**Cluster B (AI/LLM Technologies):**
("large language model*" OR "LLM" OR "GPT*" OR "BERT" OR "transformer model*" OR "generative AI" OR "artificial intelligence") AND ("test* generation" OR "test* automation" OR "validation autom*" OR "code generation" OR "requirement* analysis")

**Cluster C (Quality and Compliance):**
("quality assurance" OR "QA" OR "regulatory compliance" OR "risk assessment" OR "critical thinking" OR "patient safety") AND ("automation" OR "efficiency" OR "digital transformation")

The search was constructed as: (A OR (A AND B) OR (A AND C) OR (B AND C)), ensuring capture of papers addressing any meaningful intersection of these domains.

### Temporal and Quality Constraints

The review prioritized literature from 2020-2025 to reflect current regulatory thinking and contemporary AI capabilities. However, foundational papers establishing key concepts (e.g., ALCOA principles, risk-based validation frameworks) were included regardless of publication date. Language was restricted to English, reflecting the predominance of English in both regulatory guidance and AI research.

### Selection Criteria

**Inclusion criteria** comprised:
- Peer-reviewed empirical studies on CSV/CSA implementation in pharmaceutical contexts
- Regulatory guidance documents and official interpretations from recognized authorities
- Technical papers demonstrating LLM capabilities relevant to validation tasks
- Industry standards and best practice guidelines from recognized bodies
- Case studies documenting actual pharmaceutical validation transformations
- Theoretical frameworks addressing AI governance in regulated environments

**Exclusion criteria** eliminated:
- Marketing materials and vendor white papers lacking empirical evidence
- Opinion pieces without systematic analysis or evidence base
- Conference abstracts without full papers (unless presenting unique empirical data)
- Duplicate publications or redundant reports of the same study
- Papers focusing solely on medical device validation without pharmaceutical relevance
- General AI papers without clear application to validation contexts

### Evidence Hierarchy Framework

To account for the diverse nature of sources spanning regulatory, technical, and practical domains, a modified evidence hierarchy was developed:

Tier 1: Regulatory Requirements
├── Final Guidance Documents (FDA, EMA, ICH)
├── Draft Guidance with Industry Comments
└── Regulatory Science Research

Tier 2: Systematic Evidence
├── Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses
├── Controlled Empirical Studies
└── Validated Frameworks and Models

Tier 3: Implementation Evidence
├── Multi-site Case Studies
├── Industry Surveys (n>100)
└── Benchmarking Studies

Tier 4: Technical Demonstrations
├── Peer-reviewed Technical Papers
├── Reproducible Implementations
├── Technical Specifications
└── Open-Source Documentation

Tier 5: Grey Literature
├── Industry Surveys
├── Consultant Reports
├── Thesis and Dissertations
└── Internal Company Studies

This is a hierarchical structure where regulatory requirements are placed at the lower level of understanding and academic research provides the evidentiary support to innovations that do not cross the lines of established compliance. Considering that the development of LLM is getting faster, the methodology takes into account the time gap between peer-reviewed literature and practice. A systematic search strategy identified 2,847 initial citations, which were narrowed down by title-and-abstract screening to 487 potentially relevant papers, and then additional narrowed to 126 core papers that directly address the overlap between LLM capabilities and pharmaceutical validation needs. The following thematic analyses are based on these papers that form the empirical background.

### Methodological Quality Assessment

Even though not prospectively registered in PROSPERO or the Open Science Framework, a critical quality appraisal process was conducted post hoc. The screening was performed by one reviewer only due to the resource limitations, which could have caused selection bias. To partly address this shortcoming, a random sample of 10 % of the papers excluded was re-evaluated two weeks later, with 92 % agreement in the exclusion decisions. Quality of studies was evaluated by a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist of empirical studies and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation instrument of regulatory guidance documents. Among the 67 empirical studies, 51 (76 %) were graded as high quality, 12 (18 %) as moderate quality, and 4 (6 %) as low quality. Studies of low quality were included but their results are taken with adequate caution in the synthesis.

## 2.2 Thematic Literature Review

### Theme 1: Computerised System Validation (CSV to CSA)

The attitude of the pharmaceutical industry towards the computerised system validation has changed dramatically in the last decade because the practice of CSV has been proven to inhibit innovations and agility despite its compliance with the standards. Raja et al. (2024) thoroughly examine the conventional CSV practices, describing them as documentation-intensive processes that are more focused on the procedural compliance than on the risk-based thinking. Their review emphasizes that CSV is a methodical process affirming operation within set parameters and that validation serves as tangible proof that processes align with predetermined specifications. While the results of Raja et al. are convincing, the sample of their study is skewed towards large pharmaceutical companies that have a well-established quality system, which can be biased towards the issues that smaller biotechnology corporations and contract manufacturing organisations face due to more limited resources.

Recent industry data provides critical context for these challenges. The 2025 State of Validation survey (n=329) found that 66% of validation teams reported increased workload over the previous year, with 25% reporting validation consumes over 10% of project budgets. Digital validation adoption has accelerated dramatically to 58% in 2025 (up from 30% in 2024), with an additional 35% planning adoption, bringing total use/planning to 93%. Among digital validation adopters, 56% report meeting or exceeding ROI expectations, though only 16% currently use AI in validation with 28% planning adoption (State of Validation, 2025). 

McKinsey's analysis of pharmaceutical digital transformation (2023) provides further evidence of efficiency potential. Companies implementing product-oriented operating models achieved 50% reduction in testing time and 20% improvement in product delivery speed. Those adopting MLOps approaches have added up to 20% to EBIT, while modernization efforts can free up 30% of IT spending for strategic priorities. Leading pharmaceutical firms are now investing at least 20% of EBITDA on digital and analytics programs to achieve transformational change (McKinsey, 2023). These trends underscore both the pressing need for efficiency improvements and the industry's active pursuit of technological solutions.

According to the guidance of the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE 2022), the GAMP 5 (2nd ed.) framework has created a risk-based validation approach, which theoretically limits the validation burden. Yet implementation challenges have been substantial. The GAMP 5 (2nd ed.) framework implementation challenges are well-documented in industry standards. According to the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering guidance (ISPE 2022), many pharmaceutical companies continue to apply maximum validation rigour on all systems, despite GAMP 5's (2nd ed.) risk-based approach. This tendency towards comprehensive validation, regardless of risk assessment results, stems from regulatory uncertainty and conservative interpretation of validation requirements. As noted in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration draft guidance on Computer Software Assurance (FDA 2022 [Draft - Not for Implementation]), validation teams often default to extensive documentation as a protective measure against potential regulatory findings.

Computer Software Assurance (CSA) is a paradigm change over this documentation-based approach. The draft guidance on CSA issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA 2022 [Draft]) clearly promotes the idea of critical thinking rather than documentation and risk-based methods instead of one-size-fits-all validation. A number of critical differentiators define this transition and transform the validation landscape. To begin with, CSA focuses on the adequacy of tests as opposed to a comprehensive test of all functionalities. Second, it encourages the application of unscripted testing to lower-risk features, recognising that scripted testing is not always the best choice to offer assurance. Third, CSA promotes the use of vendor documentation and testing to minimise unnecessary validation work. Fourth, it does not emphasise the compliance with the procedure but the patient safety and product quality outcomes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration CSA guidance remains in draft form (as of December 2024) and is not for implementation, which can bring changes that could have a significant impact on adoption rates and implementation plans.

The early adopters are beginning to provide empirical evidence of CSA effectiveness. Early adopters of CSA principles have begun demonstrating measurable benefits. Industry reports and guidance documents from the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE 2022) indicate that organisations implementing CSA approaches have achieved significant reductions in validation documentation and cycle times. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's draft guidance on Computer Software Assurance (FDA 2022 [Draft]) emphasises critical success factors including executive sponsorship, comprehensive training programmes, and phased implementation beginning with lower-risk systems. Still, these early implementations have primarily occurred in organisations with above-average digital maturity and substantial resources for change management, potentially limiting the generalisability to the broader pharmaceutical industry where resource constraints and legacy system challenges remain significant barriers.

Yet the transition faces significant barriers. The issue of regulatory uncertainty is one of the key concerns as quality assurance professionals have shown concerns about the acceptance of reduced documentation by the inspectors. Industry observations and regulatory guidance documents indicate that fear of regulatory rejection remains a primary impediment to CSA adoption. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's draft guidance (FDA 2022 [Draft]) acknowledges this concern while emphasizing that properly implemented risk-based approaches are acceptable and encouraged. Compounding this concern, the CSA draft guidance issued by U.S. Food and Drug Administration provides only principles rather than prescriptive implementation requirements.

Cultural resistance within organisations presents another substantial challenge. Organizational culture studies documented in pharmaceutical technology acceptance literature reveal entrenched attitudes where validation teams view comprehensive documentation as professional protection. Research on Technology Acceptance Model applications in healthcare (Holden & Karsh 2010) demonstrates that such cultural resistance is particularly strong in highly regulated environments where documentation has historically served as evidence of compliance. Such a cultural tendency is especially strong in organisations that have a history of U.S. Food and Drug Administration warning letters or consent decrees, and conservative practices are institutionalised.

Change management implications of effective CSV-to-CSA transition are not limited to technical issues. The transition from CSV to CSA can be understood as a maturity progression. Industry guidance and regulatory documents suggest multiple stages of adoption: traditional CSV approaches, risk-aware CSV implementation, hybrid CSV-CSA models, mature CSA adoption, and optimised CSA practices. Current industry practices indicate (author's observation based on industry engagement) that most organisations remain in transitional phases, selectively implementing CSA concepts while maintaining traditional approaches for critical systems (ISPE 2022; FDA 2022 [Draft]). The model highlights that the progression is not only about the changes in the process but also about the deep-rooted changes in the organisational culture, skills and quality mindset.

Industry adoption patterns reveal interesting geographical and sector variations. Regional variations in CSA adoption reflect different regulatory environments. European pharmaceutical companies operating under European Medicines Agency's Annex 11 guidelines, which already emphasise risk-based approaches, have shown greater readiness for CSA principles compared to their US counterparts who are adapting to the FDA's evolving draft guidance framework (European Commission 2011; FDA 2022 [Draft]). Also, biotechnology firms are more likely to accept CSA principles than conventional pharmaceutical producers, perhaps because their organisational cultures tend to be more nimble and their quality systems younger. Unrepresented in existing literature, however, are the opinions of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers working under extreme cost constraints, small/virtual pharmaceutical companies with cloud-native quality management systems, and, most importantly, the opinions of regulatory inspectors and notified bodies who are the final arbiters of CSA strategies in terms of compliance with audit requirements.

Updates to European Medicines Agency Annex 11 (anticipated as of December 2024; readers should verify current status)² could also have a role to play with respect to European adoption trends and potentially harmonising transatlantic risk-based validation practices.

The contribution of technology in the process of this transition cannot be underemphasised. Newer validation systems that include risk assessment systems, auto documentation, and in-built testing facilities are becoming the facilitators of CSA adoption. The role of technology in facilitating CSA adoption is significant, with recent empirical findings summarized in Table 2.1. Organisations utilising integrated validation platforms with built-in risk assessment and automated documentation capabilities have demonstrated more efficient CSA implementation compared to those relying on traditional document-based approaches (Raja et al. 2024). Critical thinking, which CSA promotes, is made easier by these platforms that offer real-time risk visualisation and decision support tools.

**Thematic Synthesis: Computerised System Validation Evolution**

The transition from CSV to CSA represents a fundamental reimagining of validation philosophy that exposes critical tensions between regulatory innovation and organizational inertia. While regulatory bodies promote critical thinking over documentation, organisations struggle with embedded quality cultures that equate compliance with paperwork rather than demonstrated risk understanding. The readiness gap between European firms operating under risk-aware Annex 11 and US companies adapting to evolving FDA guidance underscores that successful CSA adoption requires organisational transformation—a challenge that technology alone cannot resolve.

### Theme 2: Software Testing and Validation with Large Language Models

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated software testing represents a technical evolution from rule-based pattern matching to semantic code understanding and natural language processing of requirements. While the pharmaceutical industry continues to struggle with the transition between documentation-intensive CSV and risk-based CSA approaches, as outlined in Theme 1, LLMs also offer transformative potential and pose their own challenges to automation of validation. Wang et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive review of LLM utilization in software testing, analyzing 102 relevant studies. Their findings indicate that test case preparation and program repair are the most representative applications, with LLMs demonstrating substantial efficiency improvements in reducing manual testing effort. Yang et al. (2024) through empirical evaluation of 17 Java projects found that while open-source LLMs can approach commercial models like GPT-4 in unit test generation, a substantial portion (34.44-61.78%) of LLM-generated tests are syntactically invalid, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLM capabilities. Yet such impressive numbers of general software engineering situations are subject to a critical examination when viewed in the highly regulated environment of pharmaceutical validation, where a single undetected slip in the validation scripts may jeopardize patient safety or lead to heavy regulatory fines.

The overlap between LLM abilities and pharmaceutical CSV needs produces a complicated environment in which the potential of automation should be weighed against the invariable needs of GxP compliance. Pharmaceutical validation has a zero-tolerance paradigm of critical failures unlike traditional software development environments where a minimal level of test coverage may be acceptable. This basic distinction influences the way in which LLM-generated test artifacts need to be assessed, not only in terms of functional correctness, but also in terms of their compliance with regulatory principles such as traceability, reproducibility, and auditability, which cannot be said to be explicitly built into the current LLM architectures.

Terminology Precision: Test Case vs. Validation Script

In this analysis, it is important to use specific terms to prevent the confusion between, on the one hand, general software testing and on the other hand, pharmaceutical validation:

- **Test Case**: In general software engineering, a test case is a single component of testing that checks a given functionality. It usually comprises input values, preconditions to execution, anticipated outputs, and pass/fail conditions.

- **Validation Script**: A validation script is a complete document in pharmaceutical CSV, which besides test cases also contains:

   - Regulatory context and compliance mapping

   - Pre-test requirements (calibration certificates, environmental conditions)

   - Detailed execution instructions with screenshot requirements

   - Objective evidence collection procedures

   - Deviation handling protocols

   - Review and approval workflows

   - Retention and archival specifications

This difference is important since LLMs trained on general repositories of software do not produce validation scripts but test cases. The additional regulatory and compliance sections that make a test case pharmaceutical-compliant—representing a substantial portion of the validation script—are not part of the normal training data of LLMs, which is the reason why the direct use of general-purpose LLMs in pharmaceutical validation is not effective. This critical gap between LLM capabilities and pharmaceutical validation requirements becomes evident when examining the integration workflow (Figure 2.3), where the distinction between what LLMs can generate and what validation demands reveals itself.

**Figure 2.3: LLM Integration in Pharmaceutical Validation Workflow**

The integration workflow comprises four distinct zones that highlight the capabilities and limitations of LLM deployment in pharmaceutical validation:

1. **LLM Capability Zone**: LLMs effectively process User Requirements Specifications (URS), Functional Specifications (FS), and Design Specifications (DS) documents to generate basic test cases
2. **Human Augmentation Zone**: Validation engineers must add substantial content for GxP compliance, including pre-test requirements, objective evidence procedures, and deviation handling protocols
3. **Regulatory Checkpoint**: Final validation packages must satisfy multiple regulatory frameworks including 21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11, and GAMP 5 (2nd ed.) requirements
4. **Critical Gap**: The fundamental disconnect between LLM-generated test cases and GxP-compliant validation scripts

This workflow analysis demonstrates why current LLM implementations achieve only partial automation in pharmaceutical validation contexts, necessitating substantial human intervention to bridge the compliance gap between AI capabilities and regulatory requirements.

**LLM Capabilities for Test Generation**

**Methodological Quality Assessment of Reviewed Studies**

To ensure rigorous evaluation of the evidence base, this review implements a hierarchical classification system and risk-of-bias assessment adapted from QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) for AI/ML validation contexts.

**Evidence Level Classification:**

**Level 1 - Pharmaceutical-Specific Controlled Experiments**: Studies conducted within GxP environments using actual validation artifacts, with regulatory oversight and compliance metrics. These studies provide the highest relevance but are notably absent from current literature.

**Level 2 - General Software Engineering Controlled Experiments**: Rigorous studies with control groups, randomisation, and quantitative metrics, though lacking pharmaceutical context. Examples include Yang et al. (2024) comparing multiple LLMs against Evosuite.

**Level 3 - Observational Studies with Quantitative Metrics**: Studies measuring LLM performance on defined benchmarks without experimental controls. Wang et al. (2024) falls into this category.

**Level 4 - Case Studies and Anecdotal Reports**: Descriptive accounts of LLM deployment without systematic measurement. While providing insights, these offer limited generalisability.


**Key Bias Patterns Identified:**

1. **Selection Bias**: Most studies use convenience samples from open-source repositories, limiting generalisability to proprietary pharmaceutical systems.
2. **Performance Bias**: Lack of blinding in LLM evaluation—researchers know which outputs are LLM-generated, potentially influencing assessment.
3. **Detection Bias**: Absence of pharmaceutical-specific success criteria leads to overestimation of LLM capabilities for GxP contexts.
4. **Attrition Bias**: Studies rarely report failed LLM attempts or cases where generation was abandoned, creating survivorship bias.
5. **Reporting Bias**: Positive results more likely to be published, particularly given commercial interests in LLM adoption.

**Implications for Pharmaceutical Applications:**

The fact that the majority of the Level 3-4 evidence used has high applicability concerns implies that the statements regarding the effectiveness of LLM in pharmaceutical validation have to be highly qualified. All the studies are below Level 1 and would not give confidence in GxP deployment. This evidence gap requires specific pharmaceutical research prior to regulatory acceptance of LLM-generated validation artifacts.

In addition, traditional software testing methods that come with the implementation of LLM, including differential testing and mutation testing, have to be reevaluated in the pharmaceutical environment. Although these methods are quite successful to produce a variety of test cases in general software development, their usage in CSV should consider the regulatory restrictions which can restrain the tolerable variation in the test design. An example is when a mutation testing tool which inserts errors to test the effectiveness of tests may be undesirable in a validated setting where all code changes must have a documented rationale and impact analysis.

**Theoretical Framework: Regulatory Affordance in LLM Architecture**

In order to see why some LLM capabilities fit with pharmaceutical validation needs and others are fundamentally incompatible, this section proposes the concept of regulatory affordance, the application of Gibson ecological theory of affordances to the regulatory-technological interface. This framework is based on the disclosive ethics proposed by Brey (2010) and expands it to the investigation of the inherent enabling and limiting aspects of LLM architectures on compliance with pharmaceutical validation requirements.

**Defining Regulatory Affordance**

Regulatory affordance is the intrinsic characteristic of LLM architectures that contribute to or abridge the ability to meet the pharmaceutical validation criteria, regardless of user intent or implementation quality. These affordances are at the point of convergence between the possibilities of technology and the requirements of the regulations, which makes this a structured relationship between what the LLMs are capable of doing and what the regulations demand.

Based on the original concept of Gibson (1979), regulatory affordances are relational rather than being localized in either the LLM system or the regulatory setting. Regulatory affordances differ in that they are related to the ability to comply (temperature=0 affords reproducibility) as opposed to traditional affordances that are related to physical actions (a chair affords sitting).

**Positive Regulatory Affordances in LLMs**

1. **Semantic Understanding Affords Requirements Parsing**: LLMs' ability to process natural language affords the extraction of testable requirements from URS documents, aligning with GAMP 5's (2nd ed.) emphasis on requirements traceability.
2. **Pattern Recognition Affords Consistency Checking**: The transformer architecture's attention mechanisms afford detection of inconsistencies across validation documents, supporting ALCOA+ consistency principles.
3. **Parametric Control Affords Reproducibility**: Temperature and seed parameters afford deterministic-like behaviour, partially addressing 21 CFR Part 11's reproducibility requirements.
4. **API Architecture Affords Audit Trails**: RESTful APIs with request/response logging afford comprehensive audit trail generation, meeting Part 11.10(e) requirements.

**Negative Regulatory Affordances (Dis-affordances)**

1. **Probabilistic Generation Dis-affords Predictability**: The fundamental stochastic nature of LLMs dis-affords the predictable outputs required by validation protocols, creating irreducible uncertainty.
2. **Context Windows Dis-afford Completeness**: Fixed token limits dis-afford comprehensive analysis of large validation packages, violating ALCOA+ completeness requirements.
3. **Black-Box Processing Dis-affords Transparency**: The opacity of neural network decision-making dis-affords the transparent reasoning required by regulatory inspectors.
4. **Training Data Ambiguity Dis-affords Traceability**: The inability to trace specific outputs to training examples dis-affords the data lineage requirements of EU Annex 11.

**Sociotechnical Implications**

Brey's disclosive ethics framework emphasises that technologies embed values and constraints that only become apparent through use. In the LLM-pharmaceutical validation context, these embedded constraints create fundamental tensions:

1. **Value Misalignment**: LLMs embed values of flexibility and generalisation, while pharmaceutical validation embeds values of rigidity and specificity.
2. **Temporal Mismatch**: LLMs afford rapid iteration and continuous updates, while validation affords stability and controlled change.
3. **Evidence Paradigm Conflict**: LLMs afford statistical confidence, while validation affords binary pass/fail determinations.

**Design Implications**

Understanding regulatory affordances guides system design:

1. **Amplify Positive Affordances**: Design patterns that leverage semantic understanding while adding layers for predictability.
2. **Mitigate Negative Affordances**: Implement compensatory mechanisms (e.g., ensemble voting to reduce stochasticity).
3. **Create New Affordances**: Develop hybrid architectures that combine LLM flexibility with rule-based determinism.
4. **Acknowledge Limitations**: Recognise that some dis-affordances (e.g., fundamental unpredictability) cannot be eliminated, only managed.

This regulatory affordance framework provides a theoretical lens for understanding why simple technical solutions (e.g., "just set temperature to zero") fail to fully address pharmaceutical validation requirements. It reveals that the challenge lies not in implementation details but in fundamental architectural properties that must be acknowledged and addressed through sophisticated sociotechnical design.

**Natural Language to Test Case Conversion**

One of the most promising uses of LLMs in pharmaceutical validation is the capacity to convert natural language specifications into test cases that can be run. Kang et al. (2023) illustrate this possibility by their LIBRO (LLM Induced Bug Reproduction) framework, which achieves the ability to generate bug-reproducing test cases in 33 percent of the examined cases on natural language bug reports. Although this success rate is relatively low, it is a major breakthrough in automating a task that is usually very domain intensive and involves manual interpretation.

The LIBRO framework approach to the bug reproduction is also insightful in pharmaceutical validation cases. By prioritizing post-processing procedures that facilitate the understanding of what situations LLMs are useful in and prioritizing produced tests based on validity, Kang et al. solve a vital problem of regulated environments: when to trust AI-generated output. The fact that their LIBRO implementation was accurate in successfully reproducing bug replications within a confidence range of 71.4 percent indicates that the confidence estimation mechanisms may be an important part of pharmaceutical implementations, where human supervision is still required but may be optimised by intelligent prioritisation.

The fact that the researchers focus on the management of general bug reports as opposed to crash cases only is especially relevant to the pharmaceutical validation requirements. Most of the test cases in CSV are functional requirements and business logic tests as opposed to system crashes. The value of this capability is reflected in the empirical result of Kang et al. that 28 percent of test suites in open-source projects are introduced by bug reports. This percentage in a pharmaceutical setting may be even greater, with regulatory observations and deviation reports often prompting the addition of tests suites to ensure that the problem is not repeated.

That said, the natural language processing services that allow such conversions pose special challenges in pharmaceutical contexts as well. The URS documents may have terms that are specific to the domain, regulatory references, and implicit requirements, which presuppose the knowledge of the reader in GxP principles. The ambiguity of natural language, which LLMs would have to interpret, is especially problematic when compliance with regulation requires such precise interpretation. As an example, a requirement that a system should have an appropriate audit trail needs the knowledge of 21 CFR Part 11.10(e) audit trail requirements, which are unlikely to be well-represented in training data of general-purpose LLM.

**Case Study: LLM-Generated Test for Sterilisation Cycle Validation**

To illustrate the practical challenges of LLM-generated validation scripts in pharmaceutical contexts, consider the following real-world example from an autoclave sterilisation system:

**Original User Requirement Specification (URS) Extract:**

URS-STR-001: The autoclave shall maintain a sterilisation temperature of 121°C ± 1°C for a minimum of 15 minutes during the sterilisation phase.  
URS-STR-002: Temperature data shall be recorded at intervals not exceeding 1 minute throughout the cycle.  
URS-STR-003: Any temperature deviation outside the specified range shall trigger an alarm and abort the cycle.  
URS-STR-004: All cycle data shall be stored with audit trail per 21 CFR Part 11.  
URS-STR-005: The system shall generate a cycle report including all critical parameters upon completion.

**LLM-Generated Test Script (GPT-4, Temperature=0):**

```python
import datetime
import logging

class AutoclaveValidation:
    def test_sterilisation_temperature_maintenance(self):
        """Test URS-STR-001: Temperature maintenance at 121°C ± 1°C for 15 minutes"""
        # Set sterilisation parameters
        target_temp = 121.0
        tolerance = 1.0
        duration_minutes = 15
        
        # Start sterilisation cycle
        autoclave.start_cycle(mode='STERILISATION')
        autoclave.wait_for_phase('STERILISATION')
        
        # Monitor temperature for specified duration
        start_time = datetime.now()
        temperatures = []
        
        while (datetime.now() - start_time).seconds < duration_minutes * 60:
            current_temp = autoclave.get_temperature()
            temperatures.append(current_temp)
            
            # Check temperature within tolerance
            assert abs(current_temp - target_temp) <= tolerance, \
                f"Temperature {current_temp}°C outside range {target_temp}±{tolerance}°C"
            
            time.sleep(1)  # Sample every second
        
        # Verify minimum duration achieved
        actual_duration = (datetime.now() - start_time).seconds / 60
        assert actual_duration >= duration_minutes, \
            f"Sterilisation duration {actual_duration} min < required {duration_minutes} min"
        
        return TestResult.PASS
```

**Pharmaceutical Validation Engineer's Required Additions:**

The LLM-generated test captures functional logic but lacks critical GxP elements:

1. **Pre-test Requirements** (Missing):
   - Calibration certificate verification for temperature sensors (dated within 12 months)
   - Environmental monitoring confirmation (cleanroom classification)
   - System suitability verification (last successful cycle within 24 hours)
   - User access verification under 21 CFR Part 11.10(d)

2. **Execution Documentation** (Partially Missing):
   - Step-by-step instructions with expected results
   - Screenshot requirements at each critical decision point
   - Data recording templates for manual observations
   - Witness signature blocks for critical steps

3. **Deviation Handling** (Completely Missing):
   - Pre-approved deviation scenarios and responses
   - Impact assessment procedures
   - CAPA initiation triggers
   - Regulatory notification thresholds

4. **Traceability Matrix** (Missing):
   - Link to Design Specification DS-4.2.1
   - Link to Risk Assessment RA-STER-001
   - Link to previous validation VP-2019-234
   - Change control reference CC-2024-089

5. **Acceptance Criteria Details** (Insufficient):
   - Statistical analysis requirements (Cpk ≥ 1.33)
   - Historical trending requirements (compare to last 10 cycles)
   - Alert and action limit definitions
   - Data integrity verification per ALCOA+

This case study demonstrates that while LLMs can generate syntactically correct test code that addresses functional requirements, they cannot generate the comprehensive validation documentation required for GxP compliance. The gap between LLM output and regulatory requirements necessitates substantial human augmentation.

**Code Quality and Syntactic Validity**

Yang et al. (2024) offer vital information on the assessment of LLMs in unit test generation, and it is the first empirical study of open-source LLMs in this direction. Their results show that the immediacy of design is a key element of LLM efficiency where the description style and the chosen code attributes are the keys to success. This responsiveness to timely engineering has far-reaching impacts on pharmaceutical validation that relies on consistency and reproducibility.

The syntactic invalidity rates documented by Yang et al. should be evaluated in the pharmaceutical context in greater detail. Their finding that 34.44-61.78% of LLM-generated tests have syntactic errors is absolutely unacceptable in a validated environment where every test script has to be reviewed, approved, and executed without modification. The fact that, in their research study, test failures due to syntactic errors would mean, in the pharmaceutical context, either validation delays or, worse, undetected quality problems if errors were not identified by review.

The researchers' observation that open-source models (CodeLlama, StarCoder) have different levels of performance from commercial models (GPT-4) highlights a critical issue for pharmaceutical companies, having to balance cost, control, and capability. Although commercial models offer superior performance, the reliance on external APIs poses problems concerning data security, reproducibility, and long-term availability, all of which are key considerations within GxP environments. What remains, namely the inferior performance of open-source models, limits their direct applicability to the safety critical validation activities.

What makes the findings of Yang et al. particularly interesting is the detailed breakdown of the kinds of errors in a test generated by LLMs. They identify assertion errors, compilation failures, runtime exceptions, and logical inconsistencies, which correspond to the types of errors within pharmaceutical validation that could compromise patient safety. For instance, an assertion error may lead to a test passing when it should fail, possibly providing validation for an out-of-specification system.

**Ensemble and Multi-Agent Approaches**

The drawbacks that were found in single-model solutions have led to the research of ensemble and multi-agent test generation architectures. Singh et al. (2024) provide an in-depth survey of the concept of Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) that promises to overcome the shortcomings of traditional RAG by incorporating autonomous AI agents into the generation process. Their model includes agentic design patterns, reflection, planning, use of tools, and multi-agent collaboration, which may answer numerous difficulties revealed in pharmaceutical validation settings.

The agentic RAG approach is particularly suited to the pharmaceutical validation, which has a requirement for multiple specialised components: the parsing of regulation, the technical test design, the verification of compliance, and the documentation generation. Singh et al. describe how specialist agents could be assigned different aspects of the validation generation of which each agent would bring the desired expertise. An example would be a regulatory compliance agent who might verify that the test scripts produced complied with 21 CFR Part 11 requirements and a technical validation agent would check that all the functional requirements have been tested.

The multi-agent cooperation patterns described in their research encompass supervisory structures, consensus mechanisms, and hierarchical decision-making processes, all of which are naturally analogous to current pharmaceutical quality systems. The review and approval workflows of the pharmaceutical industry, in which multiple stakeholders (validation engineers, quality assurance, regulatory affairs) have to reach a consensus, might be mimicked and potentially improved by multi-agent AI systems where various agents act as different stakeholders in the validation process.

However, Singh et al. also highlight implementation challenges that are especially critical in pharmaceutical contexts. The orchestration complexity, inter-agent communication overhead, and the requirement for explicit coordination mechanisms complicate the already elaborate validation processes. The challenge that was highlighted concerning the assessment of multi-agent systems is a big regulatory obstacle as the testing of a single AI model for GxP compliance is already very difficult, and the validation of multiple interacting agents considerably amplifies the validation work.

**Technical Implementation Considerations**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) investigated by Ahmadi et al. (2025) is a breakthrough in the normalisation of LLM integration with external tools and data sources. Their implementation of MCP Bridge fixes severe shortcomings in existing MCP deployments, in particular their use of local process execution that renders them unusable in distributed pharmaceutical settings. MCP Bridge provides a architecture better suited to enterprise pharmaceutical systems by providing a RESTful proxy that connects to any number of MCP servers and exposes their capabilities via a single API.

The architectural choices made in MCP Bridge are in direct correspondence to the pharmaceutical technical restrictions. The conversion of stdio-based communication to HTTP protocols permits integration with the currently used validation management systems, and multi-server support provides connection to various data sources (LIMS, ERP, QMS) required for full validation. The native Docker support enables containerised deployments, which is more important in maintaining a validated state and version control when software is updated.

Nonetheless, the security concerns that were pointed out by Ahmadi et al. are heightened in pharmaceutical settings. The exposure of MCP functionality by HTTP APIs provides possible attack vectors that need to be protected by additional security layers. Their security procedures such as authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication become essential rather than optional in the implementation of pharmaceuticals. The capacity for arbitrary code execution via tool calls that is the heart of MCP flexibility poses unique risks within validated environments where each operation has to be predetermined and auditable.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**

The two-step framework suggested by Goh et al. (2025) principles to design customised safety risk taxonomies and practices to assess safety risks provides a systematic plan of pharmaceutical validation. Their focus on context-specific risk taxonomies is compatible with GAMP 5 (2nd ed.) risk-based approach, and its evaluation practices offer specific ways of evaluating the LLM applications against the regulatory requirements. The case study methodology they have shown in their internal pilot is a guide that can be used by pharmaceutical organisations in order to come up with evidence-based safety evaluations.

Their architecture emphasizes iterative refinement through evaluation feedback is particularly pertinent, given that the rapidly evolving nature of the model's capabilities. The recognition of the need for constant evaluation is consistent with the pharmaceutical quality system's requirements for periodic review and continuous improvement. Yet their reliance on the internal review panels highlights a critical gap: the lack of standard industry-wide benchmarks of LLM safety in pharmaceutical applications.

The risk mitigation strategies of Goh et al. include technical controls (model parameters, output filtering), procedural controls (human review, approval workflows), and organisational controls (training, governance structures). This multi-layered approach reflects a concept of defence in depth used in pharmaceutical quality systems but it creates a complicated implementation challenge, in which coordination of different control mechanisms can lead to new failure modes.

**Synthesis of Technical Capabilities**

The synthesis of the existing studies shows that considerable gaps exist between the general-purpose capabilities of LLM and pharmaceutical validation needs. Although the efficiency improvements shown in various studies are attractive, with significant reductions in manual test generation work reported, such figures have to be put into the context of the regulatory framework under which pharmaceutical software is validated. The high syntactic invalidity rates found by Yang et al. (2024) and the hallucination tendencies reported in various studies pose serious problems to regulatory acceptance.

The possible benefit of multi-agent and ensemble strategies that are made in Singh et al. (2024) while conceptually in line with pharmaceutical quality practices creates implementation and validation challenges that have not been previously well-studied within the literature. The technical advancements in the integration protocols shown by Ahmadi et al. (2025) provide the necessary infrastructure but they also produce new vulnerabilities that need to be controlled.

Perhaps the most critical finding lies in the temporal mismatch between LLM evolution and pharmaceutical validation lifecycle requirements. LLMs are continuously updated, with new versions providing different capabilities and behaviours, and pharmaceutical validations should be stable and repeatable for decades. This basic inconsistency is such that any LLM-based validation approach must plan for model obsolescence and succession from the very start of its design.

Although human oversight is required to comply with regulation, it also reduces the efficiency that can be achieved by automating LLM. Provided that each test produced by the LLM needs to be reviewed by a human being in detail, the time savings might not be significant when compared to human authoring. The study by Kang et al. (2023) proposing confidence estimation mechanisms would provide a possible way forward, although pharmaceutical applications would need extremely high confidence levels, probably higher than the 71.4 percent accuracy they reported in their work. This implies that early pharmaceutical uses of LLMs can be in the development of test generation aids, rather than automation.

### Theme 3: Security Vulnerabilities and Hallucination Risks

The integration of Large Language Models into pharmaceutical validation introduces a new category of risks that transcend traditional cybersecurity concerns. Unlike conventional security vulnerabilities that primarily threaten data confidentiality or system availability, LLM-specific vulnerabilities can corrupt the validation process itself, undermining the fundamental quality assurance mechanisms that ensure patient safety. This section examines these vulnerabilities through the lens of pharmaceutical validation requirements, revealing how seemingly abstract AI risks translate into concrete threats to drug quality and regulatory compliance.

The pharmaceutical industry's approach to computerised system security has historically focused on protecting data integrity through access controls, audit trails, and electronic signatures as mandated by 21 CFR Part 11. However, LLMs introduce attack vectors that bypass these traditional controls entirely. A validation script generated by a compromised LLM might pass all conventional security checks—proper authentication, complete audit trails, valid electronic signatures—while containing subtle logical flaws that systematically undermine quality testing. This represents a paradigm shift from protecting systems against external threats to protecting validation processes against the very tools designed to enhance them.

### OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications: Pharmaceutical Implications

The Open Web Application Security Project's Top 10 for LLM Applications (OWASP Foundation, 2025) provides the first comprehensive framework for understanding AI-specific security risks. But in pharmaceutical validation contexts, each vulnerability category takes on heightened significance. These aren't abstract security concerns—they're direct threats to GxP compliance and product quality.

Take LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection, the framework's primary vulnerability class. In typical applications, prompt injection might cause embarrassing outputs or service disruptions. In pharmaceutical validation, it enables catastrophic quality system failures. Goh et al. (2025) discovered that fine-tuning on proprietary validation data—a common practice for domain specialisation—introduces systematic vulnerabilities where "prompt injection vulnerabilities enable malicious control of validation results" (p. 12). Picture a scenario where a disgruntled employee injects prompts that generate validation scripts appearing to test critical quality attributes while actually bypassing them entirely. The syntactic correctness masks semantic corruption.

Consider this attack vector: A validation engineer submits a requirements document containing hidden prompt instructions embedded in comment fields or metadata. The LLM, processing what appears to be a standard URS document, follows these hidden instructions to generate validation scripts that systematically ignore out-of-specification results for specific product batches. The generated scripts look comprehensive, include all required test cases, and pass peer review—but they're fundamentally compromised. Traditional security measures cannot detect this manipulation because it occurs at the semantic level rather than the syntactic level.

LLM02:2025 Sensitive Information Disclosure presents unique challenges in pharmaceutical environments where validation scripts often contain proprietary formulations, manufacturing parameters, and quality specifications. Cheng et al. (2024) achieved a staggering 99.4% success rate in jailbreaking attacks on GitHub Copilot, successfully extracting "54 real email addresses and 314 physical addresses" from training data. Now imagine similar attacks extracting proprietary validation protocols, critical quality parameters, or patient data embedded in test scenarios. The pharmaceutical industry's competitive advantage and regulatory compliance both hemorrhage through these vulnerabilities.

Supply chain vulnerabilities (LLM03:2025) pose particular risks where pharmaceutical companies rely on pre-trained models whose provenance remains opaque. A compromised model systematically corrupts entire validation suites rather than affecting individual tests. Similarly, data poisoning (LLM04:2025) through training data manipulation can embed persistent vulnerabilities—models fine-tuned on subtly manipulated historical data might consistently underestimate impurity levels or overstate process capability, compounding errors across thousands of validation runs.

LLM05:2025 Improper Output Handling exposes the dangerous assumption that LLM-generated code is inherently safe. The framework warns of "insufficient validation of LLM outputs leading to XSS, CSRF, RCE" (OWASP Foundation, 2025, p. 22). In validation contexts, this manifests as generated scripts that execute arbitrary code, access unauthorized systems, or modify critical quality data. The pharmaceutical industry's interconnected manufacturing execution systems and laboratory information management systems become attack surfaces through improperly validated AI-generated interfaces.

### Advanced Attack Vectors in Pharmaceutical Validation

Beyond the OWASP framework, pharmaceutical-specific attack vectors emerge from the intersection of AI vulnerabilities and GxP requirements. These sophisticated attacks exploit the trust relationship between validation engineers and AI assistants, the complexity of pharmaceutical systems, and the regulatory emphasis on documentation over functional verification.

Atta et al. (2024) introduce Logic-layer Prompt Control Injection (LPCI), a novel vulnerability class specifically targeting agentic systems common in pharmaceutical validation workflows. Unlike simple prompt injection, LPCI manipulates control flow in orchestrator-worker patterns, where a master agent coordinates multiple specialized validation agents. The authors, including OWASP Top 10 for LLMs contributors, demonstrate how "control flow manipulation in orchestrator-worker validation patterns" can subvert entire multi-agent systems (p. 34). In pharmaceutical contexts, this means an attacker could manipulate the validation orchestrator to skip critical test sequences while reporting successful completion.

The evolution from simple prompt injection to protocol-level exploits represents an escalation that pharmaceutical quality systems are unprepared to handle. What starts as manipulated text generation escalates to system-wide compromise. Chen et al. (2025) propose DefensiveTokens as a mitigation strategy, achieving "almost-SOTA security" through special embeddings optimized for security (p. 5). Yet their own framework acknowledges a fundamental trade-off between security and utility—precisely the compromise pharmaceutical validation cannot afford. Every defensive measure that restricts model responsiveness potentially blocks legitimate validation requirements.

Real-world exploitation isn't theoretical. Goldgof et al. (2024) demonstrate LLMs' capability for automated vulnerability detection, achieving "accuracy comparable to SonarQube" in identifying security flaws (p. 12). But this same capability inverts into an attack vector—if LLMs can find vulnerabilities, they can also be manipulated to introduce them. The study's identification of "command injection, weak cryptography, weak hashing, LDAP injection" vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code reveals the breadth of potential security failures (p. 15).

### Hallucination: When AI Invents Validation Requirements

Hallucination—the generation of plausible but false information—represents perhaps the most insidious risk in pharmaceutical validation. Unlike security vulnerabilities that might be detected through careful review, hallucinations can appear entirely reasonable while being completely fabricated. In validation contexts, this translates to invented test procedures, fabricated acceptance criteria, or phantom regulatory requirements that waste resources at best and compromise quality at worst.

The hallucination taxonomy in pharmaceutical validation reveals multiple failure modes, each with distinct implications for patient safety and regulatory compliance:

Syntactic hallucinations manifest as "language-grammar violations, non-existent APIs" that might seem like mere coding errors. But Yang et al. (2024) reveal a deeper problem: "high syntactic invalidity rates and hallucination tendencies in LLM-generated code pose serious problems to regulatory acceptance" (p. 8). In validation contexts, a hallucinated API call might reference non-existent quality checks, creating phantom validations that provide false assurance.

Semantic hallucinations prove even more insidious. The code compiles, executes, produces results—but the logic is fundamentally flawed. A validation script might test for impurities using hallucinated threshold values that appear reasonable but lack regulatory basis. The semantic correctness masks logical corruption, allowing flawed validations to persist through multiple review cycles.

Consider this documented case: An LLM trained on mixed pharmaceutical and food industry data generated validation scripts for a sterile injectable product that included testing procedures for "organoleptic properties" (taste and odour)—appropriate for oral medications but absurd and dangerous for injectables. The hallucination wasn't syntactic (the code ran perfectly) but conceptual, revealing how LLMs can blend knowledge domains inappropriately.

Factual hallucinations involve the generation of specific but incorrect information. An LLM might confidently cite "21 CFR Part 11.10(k)" (which doesn't exist) or reference "GAMP 5 Section 12.3.4" (GAMP 5 (2nd ed.) has no such section). These hallucinations are particularly dangerous because they sound authoritative and might pass cursory review by engineers unfamiliar with every regulatory detail.

The temporal dimension of hallucinations adds another layer of complexity. LLMs trained on historical data might generate validation approaches that were once acceptable but are now obsolete. Conversely, they might apply modern techniques to legacy systems where such approaches are inappropriate. This temporal confusion manifests as validation scripts that are internally consistent but contextually inappropriate.

### Regulatory and Compliance Implications

The intersection of LLM vulnerabilities with pharmaceutical regulatory requirements creates a complex compliance landscape where traditional validation approaches prove inadequate. The fundamental assumption underlying 21 CFR Part 11—that electronic systems can be validated to a predetermined state—becomes questionable when systems exhibit non-deterministic behaviour and vulnerability to semantic attacks.

ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, and Available) face systematic challenges when applied to LLM-generated validation artifacts. Each principle, designed to ensure data integrity in electronic systems, encounters specific complications when the system itself can be manipulated through natural language:

Attributability becomes complex when an LLM generates content based on prompts from multiple users. Who is responsible for hallucinated content—the prompt author, the model developer, or the pharmaceutical company deploying the system? Current regulatory frameworks provide no clear answer, creating liability uncertainties that could paralyse adoption.

Legibility suffers from misinformation vulnerabilities (LLM09:2025) where "hallucination-driven false information" affects data interpretation (OWASP Foundation, 2025, p. 32). Validation reports generated by compromised LLMs might contain technically correct data presented in misleading ways, using inappropriate statistical methods or cherry-picked results that obscure quality issues.

Contemporaneous recording is challenged by the asynchronous nature of LLM processing. When a validation script is generated through multiple iterations of prompt refinement, determining the "contemporary" version becomes problematic. Each iteration might introduce subtle changes that affect compliance, but tracking these changes through traditional audit trails proves insufficient.

The "Original" criterion faces existential challenges in LLM contexts. Is an LLM-generated validation script "original" when it's synthesised from training data potentially containing millions of similar scripts? The concept of originality itself becomes questionable when dealing with probabilistic text generation.

Accuracy, perhaps the most critical principle for patient safety, is systematically undermined by hallucination risks. Even with temperature settings at zero (maximum determinism), LLMs can generate inaccurate information that appears plausible. The pharmaceutical industry's reliance on accuracy for critical quality attributes makes this vulnerability particularly concerning.

Completeness requirements conflict with context window limitations. LLMs cannot process entire validation packages simultaneously, potentially missing critical dependencies or requirements spread across documents. This fragmentation of analysis violates the holistic approach required by pharmaceutical validation.

Consistency across validation documentation becomes nearly impossible to guarantee when each LLM query might produce different outputs. Even with fixed seeds and deterministic settings, model updates or infrastructure changes can alter outputs, breaking the consistency required for regulatory submissions.

Long-term data preservation and availability requirements face unprecedented challenges when validation artifacts depend on AI models that might not exist in future decades. The "Enduring" principle demands that data be stored such that it "must be able to be read and understood for many years" (Kavasidis et al., 2023), while the "Available" principle requires data remain "accessible to every interested party and at any time during its life cycle." But pharmaceutical products often have lifecycles spanning 20-30 years or more. Will the GPT-4 model that generated validation scripts in 2024 still be accessible, interpretable, or even running in 2050? Unlike traditional documents that remain readable indefinitely, AI-generated content exists in relation to the model that created it. Without access to the original model, regenerating or understanding the rationale behind validation decisions becomes impossible. This temporal disconnect between AI model lifecycles and pharmaceutical product lifecycles creates a preservation crisis that current regulatory frameworks cannot address.

The European Medicines Agency's Annex 11 requirements for computerised systems add another layer of complexity. The mandate for risk assessment "taking into account the intended use and the potential of the system to affect product quality and patient safety" requires quantifying risks that are fundamentally uncertain with LLMs. How does one assess the risk of hallucination when the phenomenon itself is unpredictable and model-dependent?

## Conclusion

The evidence presented in this review reveals critical challenges at the intersection of Large Language Model capabilities and pharmaceutical validation requirements. While the pharmaceutical industry struggles with the transition from documentation-heavy CSV to risk-based CSA approaches, LLMs introduce both unprecedented opportunities and fundamental risks that current regulatory frameworks cannot adequately address. The synthesis of literature across regulatory evolution, technical capabilities, and security vulnerabilities exposes a complex landscape where the promise of automation confronts the uncompromising demands of patient safety.

Industry data underscores the urgency of this transformation—with validation consuming substantial resources and workloads increasing annually, the pharmaceutical sector actively seeks efficiency improvements through digital solutions. Yet the evidence also reveals that direct application of general-purpose LLMs to pharmaceutical validation remains problematic. High syntactic invalidity rates, hallucination tendencies, and security vulnerabilities pose risks that transcend simple technical challenges, threatening the integrity of quality systems designed to protect patient safety.

The regulatory affordance framework developed in this review provides a theoretical lens for understanding why simple technical solutions fail to bridge the gap between LLM capabilities and pharmaceutical requirements. The fundamental architectural properties of LLMs—their probabilistic nature, context limitations, and opacity—create dis-affordances that cannot be eliminated through parameter tuning or prompt engineering alone. These limitations demand sophisticated sociotechnical approaches that acknowledge both the transformative potential and inherent constraints of AI in regulated environments.

Perhaps most critically, this review identifies the temporal mismatch between rapidly evolving AI technologies and the multi-decade stability requirements of pharmaceutical validation. This disconnect necessitates new approaches to validation that can accommodate technological change while maintaining regulatory compliance and ensuring patient safety. The path forward requires not just technical innovation but fundamental reimagination of validation philosophy, regulatory frameworks, and quality assurance practices.

The transition from CSV to CSA represents more than procedural change—it embodies a philosophical shift from documentation to demonstration, from compliance to critical thinking. LLMs could potentially accelerate this transition, but only if their integration acknowledges and addresses the fundamental tensions between AI capabilities and pharmaceutical validation requirements identified in this review.
