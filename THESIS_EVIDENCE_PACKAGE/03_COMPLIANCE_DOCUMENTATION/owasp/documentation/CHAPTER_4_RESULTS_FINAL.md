3. **Sample Size**: n=30 limits generalizability
4. **Research Agent**: 20% timeout rate requires optimization
5. **Wide Confidence Intervals**: 29.1% width for success rate

### 4.10 Discussion

#### 4.10.1 Interpretation of Results

The multi-agent LLM system demonstrates **conditional validation** as a proof-of-concept for pharmaceutical test generation. While the overall success rate of 76.7% falls short of the 85% target, the clear improvement trend across corpuses (64.7% → 87.5% → 100%) and high recovery rate (96.7% with retries) suggest the system is approaching production viability.

The 91.3% categorization accuracy exceeds expectations and validates the system's understanding of GAMP-5 principles. The successful triggering of human consultation for URS-025, without falling back to automated alternatives, demonstrates proper implementation of pharmaceutical safety requirements.

#### 4.10.2 Statistical Considerations

The achieved statistical power of 0.50 limits our ability to make definitive population-level claims. The wide confidence interval for success rate [59.1%, 88.2%] indicates substantial uncertainty. However, when considering the combined evidence across multiple metrics and the clear temporal improvement, the system shows promise for further development.

#### 4.10.3 Clinical Significance vs Statistical Significance

While statistical significance was not achieved for all hypotheses, the clinical significance is evident:
- 91% cost reduction has immediate practical impact
- 98.5% time reduction enables rapid validation cycles
- 100% audit trail compliance meets regulatory requirements
- Human consultation integration ensures patient safety

### 4.11 Recommendations

#### 4.11.1 Immediate Improvements
1. **Increase Timeouts**: Research agent timeout from 60s to 120s
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for timeout failures
3. **Cache Optimization**: Reduce redundant API calls
4. **Error Recovery**: Enhanced exception handling

#### 4.11.2 Future Validation
1. **Larger Sample**: n=114 minimum for 80% power
2. **Stratified Sampling**: Equal distribution across categories
3. **Longitudinal Study**: Track improvement over time
4. **Multi-site Validation**: Test across different organizations

#### 4.11.3 Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Achieve 85% first-attempt success rate
- [ ] Reduce processing time variance
- [ ] Implement external regulatory APIs
- [ ] Enhance error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Complete security audit
- [ ] Establish SLAs for human consultation

### 4.12 Conclusion

The cross-validation study of the multi-agent LLM system for pharmaceutical test generation provides mixed but promising results. While the primary success rate hypothesis was not fully supported (76.7% vs 85% target), the system demonstrates:

1. **Technical Feasibility**: 316 valid test cases generated
2. **Economic Viability**: 91% cost reduction achieved
3. **Regulatory Alignment**: GAMP-5 and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Clear upward trajectory in performance

The system represents a **conditionally validated proof-of-concept** that, with specific improvements, can transition to production use in pharmaceutical quality assurance workflows. The evidence supports continued development and expanded validation studies.
