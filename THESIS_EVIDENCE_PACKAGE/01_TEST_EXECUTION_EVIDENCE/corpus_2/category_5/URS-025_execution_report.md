# URS-025 Test Generation Execution Report

## Document Information
- **Document ID**: URS-025
- **Title**: Custom Batch Release Orchestrator  
- **Category**: Category 5 (Custom Application)
- **Domain**: Manufacturing Operations
- **Complexity**: High
- **Total Requirements**: 17 functional and regulatory requirements

## Execution Summary

### Timeline
- **Start Time**: 2025-08-21 13:20:24
- **Failure Time**: 2025-08-21 13:29:03  
- **Total Duration**: 8 minutes 39 seconds
- **Status**: FAILED (SSL connection error)

### Progress Achieved
- **Completion Percentage**: 91.7%
- **Batches Completed**: 11 of 12
- **Estimated Tests Generated**: ~25 (before failure)

## Workflow Phases

### ✅ Successfully Completed
1. **Document Ingestion**: URS-025.md loaded successfully
2. **GAMP-5 Categorization**: Correctly identified as Category 5
3. **Context Collection**: Embedded document context (1.13s)
4. **Research Phase**: Regulatory research completed
5. **Test Generation Planning**: Batch strategy established
6. **Partial Test Generation**: 11/12 batches completed successfully

### ❌ Failed Phase
- **OQ Test Generation - Batch 12**: SSL connection failure with OpenRouter API

## Technical Details

### Error Information
- **Error Type**: SSL EOF Error
- **Root Cause**: Network connectivity issue with OpenRouter API
- **Error Message**: `[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol`
- **API Endpoint**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`

### System Behavior
- **No Fallback Logic**: System correctly failed explicitly (compliance requirement)
- **Human Consultation Triggered**: Consultation ID `a3afc876-9322-4669-85df-cb00fe1cbcf8`
- **Phoenix Traces**: Captured until failure point
- **Audit Trail**: Complete regulatory audit trail maintained

## Compliance Assessment

### ALCOA+ Compliance
- ✅ **Attributable**: All actions traced to system
- ✅ **Legible**: Clear error documentation
- ✅ **Contemporaneous**: Real-time event logging
- ✅ **Original**: No data manipulation
- ✅ **Accurate**: Precise error reporting
- ❌ **Complete**: Test suite incomplete due to failure
- ✅ **Consistent**: Consistent error handling
- ✅ **Enduring**: Persistent audit records
- ✅ **Available**: All logs accessible

### 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete until failure
- ✅ **Tamper Evident**: Integrity hashes maintained
- ✅ **Record Integrity**: No data corruption

## Evidence Captured

### Files Generated
1. `URS-025_console.txt` - Complete execution log
2. `URS-025_traces.jsonl` - Phoenix observability traces
3. `URS-025_performance_metrics.json` - Detailed metrics
4. `URS-025_execution_report.md` - This report

### Missing Artifacts
- `URS-025_test_suite.json` - Generation incomplete due to SSL failure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Retry with Stable Network**: Re-execute when network connectivity is stable
2. **API Health Check**: Verify OpenRouter API status and SSL certificate validity
3. **Network Diagnostics**: Check firewall/proxy settings affecting SSL connections

### System Improvements
1. **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient network errors
2. **Health Monitoring**: Add pre-execution API connectivity validation
3. **Partial Recovery**: Allow resumption from completed batches
4. **SSL Validation**: Enhanced SSL certificate and connection validation

## Conclusion

The test generation for URS-025 achieved 91.7% completion before encountering a network-level SSL error. The system behaved correctly by:

1. Failing explicitly without fallback logic (regulatory compliance requirement)
2. Capturing complete diagnostic information
3. Maintaining comprehensive audit trails
4. Triggering appropriate human consultation processes

While the test suite generation was incomplete, all regulatory compliance requirements were met regarding error handling and documentation. The failure was external (network/SSL) rather than systemic, indicating the core system performed as designed.

**Next Action**: Retry execution with stable network connectivity to complete the remaining 8.3% of test generation.
