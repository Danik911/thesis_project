The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\",\"chunk_length\":6492,\"chunk_start_char\":16278,\"chunk_end_char\":22770,\"has_embedding\":false,\"relationships\":{\"1\":{\"node_id\":\"3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2\",\"type\":\"1\"},\"2\":{\"node_id\":\"60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c\",\"type\":\"2\"}}},\"source_file\":\"unknown\",\"creation_date\":\"unknown\",\"last_modified\":\"unknown\"},{\"title\":\"Untitled Document\",\"type\":\"testing_methodology\",\"relevance_score\":0.45425468888261966,\"content_summary\":\"PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\n\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 6492, 'chunk_start_char': 16278, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'testing_methodology', 'relevance_score': 0.45425468888261966, 'content_summary': 'PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\\\n\\\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\\\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\\\n\\\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Breastfeeding and\/or baby formula may be given on demand if a pediatric patient is unable to tolerate the fasting conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Preparation and Administration To prepare MEKINIST for oral solution, tap the bottle until powder flows freely. Add 90 mL distilled or purified water to the powder in the bottle and invert or gently shake the bottle with re-attached cap for up to 5 minutes until powder is fully dissolved yielding a clear solution. Separate the bottle adapter from the oral syringe. Insert bottle adapter into bottle neck after reconstitution of the solution. Write the discard after date. Once reconstituted, MEKINIST for oral solution can be used for 35 days. The final concentration of the solution is 0.05 mg\/mL. Administer MEKINIST for oral solution from an oral syringe or feeding tube (4 French gauge or larger). After reconstitution, store in original bottle below 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) and do not freeze. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Dose reductions for adverse reactions associated with MEKINIST are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

When coadministering with dabrafenib, take the MEKINIST oral solution on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). Breastfeeding and\/or baby formula may be given on demand if a pediatric patient is unable to tolerate the fasting conditions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Preparation and Administration To prepare MEKINIST for oral solution, tap the bottle until powder flows freely. Add 90 mL distilled or purified water to the powder in the bottle and invert or gently shake the bottle with re-attached cap for up to 5 minutes until powder is fully dissolved yielding a clear solution. Separate the bottle adapter from the oral syringe. Insert bottle adapter into bottle neck after reconstitution of the solution. Write the discard after date. Once reconstituted, MEKINIST for oral solution can be used for 35 days. The final concentration of the solution is 0.05 mg\/mL. Administer MEKINIST for oral solution from an oral syringe or feeding tube (4 French gauge or larger). After reconstitution, store in original bottle below 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) and do not freeze. 2.4 Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Dose reductions for adverse reactions associated with MEKINIST are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \\u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (\\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\",\"chunk_length\":6492,\"chunk_start_char\":16278,\"chunk_end_char\":22770,\"has_embedding\":false,\"relationships\":{\"1\":{\"node_id\":\"3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2\",\"type\":\"1\"},\"2\":{\"node_id\":\"60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c\",\"type\":\"2\"}}},\"source_file\":\"unknown\",\"creation_date\":\"unknown\",\"last_modified\":\"unknown\"},{\"title\":\"Untitled Document\",\"type\":\"testing_methodology\",\"relevance_score\":0.45425468888261966,\"content_summary\":\"PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\n\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST. Table 6 and Table 7 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST as a single agent in the METRIC study. Table 6.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased ejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%).

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\",\"chunk_length\":6492,\"chunk_start_char\":16278,\"chunk_end_char\":22770,\"has_embedding\":false,\"relationships\":{\"1\":{\"node_id\":\"3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2\",\"type\":\"1\"},\"2\":{\"node_id\":\"60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c\",\"type\":\"2\"}}},\"source_file\":\"unknown\",\"creation_date\":\"unknown\",\"last_modified\":\"unknown\"},{\"title\":\"Untitled Document\",\"type\":\"testing_methodology\",\"relevance_score\":0.45425468888261966,\"content_summary\":\"PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\n\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\",\"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\",\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 6492, 'chunk_start_char': 16278, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'testing_methodology', 'relevance_score': 0.45425468888261966, 'content_summary': 'PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\\\n\\\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\\\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\\\n\\\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 5573, 'chunk_start_char': 17197, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '7d12f61f-875e-4a11-829f-f30d9f207662', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '25774d54-c90c-4c9b-ab00-ebba95074b65', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'best_practices', 'relevance_score': 0.44497623439896306, 'content_summary': 'Create batch order in MES\\\\n2.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\", \"chunk_length\": 6492, \"chunk_start_char\": 16278, \"chunk_end_char\": 22770, \"has_embedding\": false, \"relationships\": {\"1\": {\"node_id\": \"3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2\", \"type\": \"1\"}, \"2\": {\"node_id\": \"60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c\", \"type\": \"2\"}}}, \"source_file\": \"unknown\", \"creation_date\": \"unknown\", \"last_modified\": \"unknown\"}, {\"title\": \"Untitled Document\", \"type\": \"testing_methodology\", \"relevance_score\": 0.45425468888261966, \"content_summary\": \"PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\n\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\n\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\n\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\n\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\n\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\n\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\n\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\n\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\n\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\n\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\n\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\n\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\n\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices.

Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\n\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\n\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\", \"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\", \"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\", \"CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.\", \"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 6492, 'chunk_start_char': 16278, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '3074dff7-2ac2-4bdd-b316-a69e843700f2', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '60697cad-6835-47f0-b885-cd0e69ecc10c', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'testing_methodology', 'relevance_score': 0.45425468888261966, 'content_summary': 'PHARMACEUTICAL URS DOCUMENT - TEST VALIDATION SYSTEM\\\\n\\\\nDocument Name: Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) \\\\nDocument Version: 2.1.0-VALIDATION\\\\nAuthor: Pharmaceutical Validation Team\\\\nDate: 2025-01-29\\\\n\\\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\\\nThis User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be deployed in a FDA-regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 5573, 'chunk_start_char': 17197, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '7d12f61f-875e-4a11-829f-f30d9f207662', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '25774d54-c90c-4c9b-ab00-ebba95074b65', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'best_practices', 'relevance_score': 0.44497623439896306, 'content_summary': 'Create batch order in MES\\\\n2.

The FDA's Computer Software Assurance guidance emphasizes matching validation rigor to actual risk rather than applying maximum documentation to all systems.\\\\n\\\\n**Robust scripted testing** suits high-risk functions directly impacting patient safety or product quality. These comprehensive scripts provide repeatability, traceability, and detailed evidence for regulatory inspection. Manufacturing control systems, clinical data management, and automated release testing typically warrant this approach.\\\\n\\\\n**Limited scripted testing** offers flexibility for mixed-risk systems. High-risk functions receive detailed scripts while lower-risk areas use exploratory methods. This hybrid approach optimizes resources while maintaining compliance for critical functions. Configuration testing of commercial systems often benefits from this balanced methodology.\\\\n\\\\n**Unscripted and exploratory testing** effectively validates user interfaces, workflow efficiency, and error handling in lower-risk applications. Subject matter experts leverage their experience to discover issues that scripted testing might miss. FDA explicitly endorses unscripted approaches for non-critical functions, reducing validation burden without compromising quality.\\\\n\\\\n**Ad hoc testing** provides quick verification for patches, minor configuration changes, or troubleshooting. While insufficient for initial validation, ad hoc methods support ongoing system maintenance within established change control procedures.\\\\n\\\\n## Ensuring 21 CFR Part 11 and GAMP 5 compliance\\\\n\\\\nRegulatory compliance requires consistent implementation of electronic records and signatures controls regardless of test format. **Every OQ script must verify** that systems generate tamper-evident audit trails capturing who did what, when, and why. User access controls, including unique usernames and passwords, require testing across all permission levels.\\\\n\\\\nGAMP 5 Second Edition emphasizes critical thinking over excessive documentation. Risk assessments should justify validation scope, with clear rationale for test format selection. **Leverage supplier testing** for standard functionality while focusing internal efforts on configurations and customizations. Modern approaches like continuous integration and automated testing align with GAMP 5 principles when properly documented.\\\\n\\\\nData integrity verification spans all test formats. The ALCOA+ principles (Attributable, Legible, Contemporaneous, Original, Accurate, Complete, Consistent, Enduring, Available) guide test design. **Each script should confirm** that data remains traceable, unalterable, and retrievable throughout its lifecycle.\\\\n\\\\n## Key success factors for OQ test script development\\\\n\\\\nSuccessful OQ testing begins with clear traceability from user requirements through test execution. Each test script must explicitly reference the requirements it verifies, enabling regulators to follow the validation logic. **Acceptance criteria should be specific, measurable, and directly linked** to intended use.\\\\n\\\\nTest data selection significantly impacts validation quality. Reference standards, certified datasets, and known values provide objective verification of system calculations. For Category 5 systems, mathematical proofs and parallel testing against validated systems demonstrate algorithm accuracy.\\\\n\\\\nDocumentation depth should align with risk level. High-risk Category 5 systems warrant comprehensive step-by-step scripts with detailed expected results. Lower-risk Category 3 systems may use streamlined formats focusing on key functionality. **The goal remains consistent**: demonstrate the system performs reliably for its intended use.\\\\n\\\\nModern validation embraces efficiency without sacrificing quality. Automated testing tools capture evidence while reducing manual documentation. Risk-based approaches focus efforts where they matter most. The evolution from Computer System Validation to Computer Software Assurance reflects industry maturation, emphasizing outcomes over paperwork.\\\\n\\\\nOrganizations implementing these OQ test scripts should maintain flexibility while ensuring compliance. Regular review and updates keep validation current with evolving regulations and industry practices. By matching validation rigor to actual risk and leveraging modern testing approaches, pharmaceutical companies can achieve robust system validation supporting product quality and patient safety.\\\", 'chunk_length': 6492, 'chunk_start_char': 16278, 'chunk_end_char': 22770, 'has_embedding': False, 'relationships': {<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: {'node_id': '34bedc24-07d1-4be5-af1e-ff1ea13aa3dc', 'type': <NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>}, <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: {'node_id': '0d555a4e-9db2-4eff-9ac1-b87d4422a59d', 'type': <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>}}}, 'source_file': 'unknown', 'creation_date': 'unknown', 'last_modified': 'unknown'}, {'title': 'Untitled Document', 'type': 'best_practices', 'relevance_score': 0.44395170521049054, 'content_summary': '# Realistic OQ Test Scripts for Pharmaceutical Computerized Systems Validation\\\\n\\\\nOperational Qualification (OQ) test scripts form the backbone of pharmaceutical computerized systems validation, ensuring software performs according to specifications while maintaining regulatory compliance.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST. Table 6 and Table 7 present adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, of MEKINIST as a single agent in the METRIC study. Table 6.

In both trials, patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Both trials excluded patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, history of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association), history of RVO or RPED, QTcB interval \\u2265 480 msec, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled arrhythmias, active brain metastases, or known history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Among these 559 patients, 197 (35%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 185 (33%) were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. The median age was 55 years (range: 18 to 91), 57% were male, and 98% were White, 72% had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 and 28% had ECOG performance status of 1, 64% had M1c disease, 35% had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at baseline, and 0.5% had a history of brain metastases. The most common adverse reactions (\\u2265 20%) for MEKINIST in patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI-d and COMBI-v studies were: pyrexia, nausea, rash, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension, and peripheral edema. The demographics and baseline tumor characteristics of patients enrolled in the COMBI-d study are summarized in Clinical Studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib had a median duration of exposure of 11 months (range: 3 days to 30 months) to MEKINIST. Among the 209 patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib, 26% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 6 months to 12 months while 46% were exposed to MEKINIST for > 1 year. In the COMBI-d study, adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of MEKINIST occurred in 11% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (1.4%) and decreased ejection fraction (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to dose reductions of MEKINIST occurred in 18% of patients who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib; the most frequent were pyrexia (2.9%), neutropenia (1.9%), decreased ejection fraction (1.9%), and rash (1.9%).

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.

Adult Safety Pools The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily as a single agent in 329 patients with various solid tumors enrolled in METRIC, MEK113583, and MEK111054. Among these 329 patients who received MEKINIST as a single agent, 33% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 9% were exposed for greater than one year. The pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to MEKINIST 2 mg orally, once daily, administered in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg orally, twice daily, in 1087 patients enrolled in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, COMBI-AD, and BRF113928 with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, adjuvant melanoma, or NSCLC. Among these 1087 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 70% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 21% were exposed for greater than one year. Pediatric Safety Pool The pediatric pooled safety population described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflects exposure to weight-based MEKINIST orally, once daily administered in combination with dabrafenib in 166 pediatric patients across two trials: a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive glioma requiring systemic therapy (Study G2201; n = 123) and a multi-center, open-label, multi-cohort study in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation (Study X2101; n = 43) [see Clinical Studies (14.6, 14.7)] . Among 166 patients who received MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib, 85% were exposed for 6 months and 69% were exposed for greater than one year. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions were pyrexia (66%), rash (54%), headache (40%), vomiting (38%), musculoskeletal pain (36%), fatigue (31%), dry skin (31%), diarrhea (30%), nausea (26%), epistaxis and other bleeding events (25%), abdominal pain (24%), and dermatitis acneiform (23%). The most common (> 2%) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count (20%), increased alanine aminotransferase (3.1%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (3.1%). Unresectable or Metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation-Positive Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety of MEKINIST was evaluated in the METRIC study, a randomized, open-label trial of patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received MEKINIST (N = 211) 2 mg orally once daily or chemotherapy (N = 99) (either dacarbazine 1000 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg\/m 2 every 3 weeks) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . Patients with abnormal LVEF, history of acute coronary syndrome within 6 months, or current evidence of Class II or greater congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association) were excluded. The median duration of treatment with MEKINIST was 4.3 months. In this study, 9% of patients who received MEKINIST experienced adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial medication. The most frequent adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of MEKINIST were decreased LVEF, pneumonitis, renal failure, diarrhea, and rash. Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients treated with MEKINIST. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most frequent reasons cited for dose reductions of MEKINIST.

Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and\/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 2 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. TABLE 2 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients\/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing gabapentin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events\\u2013Pediatric Patients 3 to 12 Years of Age Gabapentin use in pediatric patients with epilepsy 3 to 12 years of age is associated with the occurrence of central nervous system related adverse events. The most significant of these can be classified into the following categories: 1) emotional lability (primarily behavioral problems), 2) hostility, including aggressive behaviors, 3) thought disorder, including concentration problems and change in school performance, and 4) hyperkinesia (primarily restlessness and hyperactivity). Among the gabapentin-treated patients, most of the events were mild to moderate in intensity. In controlled trials in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, the incidence of these adverse events was: emotional lability 6% (gabapentin-treated patients) vs 1.3% (placebo-treated patients); hostility 5.2% vs 1.3%; hyperkinesia 4.7% vs 2.9%; and thought disorder 1.7% vs 0%. One of these events, a report of hostility, was considered serious. Discontinuation of gabapentin treatment occurred in 1.3% of patients reporting emotional lability and hyperkinesia and 0.9% of gabapentin-treated patients reporting hostility and thought disorder. One placebo-treated patient (0.4%) withdrew due to emotional lability. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency. In the placebo-controlled studies in patients > 12 years of age, the incidence of status epilepticus in patients receiving gabapentin was 0.6% (3 of 543) versus 0.5% in patients receiving placebo (2 of 378). Among the 2074 patients > 12 years of age treated with gabapentin across all studies (controlled and uncontrolled) 31 (1.5%) had status epilepticus. Of these, 14 patients had no prior history of status epilepticus either before treatment or while on other medications. Because adequate historical data are not available, it is impossible to say whether or not treatment with gabapentin is associated with a higher or lower rate of status epilepticus than would be expected to occur in a similar population not treated with gabapentin. Tumorigenic Potential In standard preclinical in vivo lifetime carcinogenicity studies, an unexpectedly high incidence of pancreatic acinar adenocarcinomas was identified in male, but not female, rats (See PRECAUTIONS , Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Clinical experience during gabapentin's premarketing development provides no direct means to assess its potential for inducing tumors in humans. In clinical studies in adjunctive therapy in epilepsy comprising 2085 patient-years of exposure in patients > 12 years of age, new tumors were reported in 10 patients (2 breast, 3 brain, 2 lung, 1 adrenal, 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1 endometrial carcinoma in situ ), and preexisting tumors worsened in 11 patients (9 brain, 1 breast, 1 prostate) during or up to 2 years following discontinuation of gabapentin. Without knowledge of the background incidence and recurrence in a similar population not treated with gabapentin, it is impossible to know whether the incidence seen in this cohort is or is not affected by treatment. Sudden and Unexplained Death in Patients With Epilepsy During the course of premarketing development of gabapentin 8 sudden and unexplained deaths were recorded among a cohort of 2203 patients treated (2103 patient-years of exposure). Some of these could represent seizure-related deaths in which the seizure was not observed, e.g., at night. This represents an incidence of 0.0038 deaths per patient-year. Although this rate exceeds that expected in a healthy population matched for age and sex, it is within the range of estimates for the incidence of sudden unexplained deaths in patients with epilepsy not receiving gabapentin (ranging from 0.0005 for the general population of epileptics to 0.003 for a clinical trial population similar to that in the gabapentin program, to 0.005 for patients with refractory epilepsy). Consequently, whether these figures are reassuring or raise further concern depends on comparability of the populations reported upon to the gabapentin cohort and the accuracy of the estimates provided. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)\/Multiorgan hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including gabapentin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and\/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Gabapentin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.\\\", 'CONTRAINDICATIONS Gabapentin tablets USP are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.', \\\"ADVERSE REACTIONS Postherpetic Neuralgia The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in adults, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were dizziness, somnolence, and peripheral edema. In the 2 controlled studies in postherpetic neuralgia, 16% of the 336 patients who received gabapentin and 9% of the 227 patients who received placebo discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events that most frequently led to withdrawal in gabapentin-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, and nausea. Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 3 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin-treated patients with postherpetic neuralgia participating in placebo-controlled trials and that were numerically more frequent in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 3.

There were no clinically important differences between men and women in the types and incidence of adverse events. Because there were few patients whose race was reported as other than white, there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Epilepsy The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in patients > 12 years of age, not seen at an equivalent frequency among placebo-treated patients, were somnolence, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, and nystagmus. The most commonly observed adverse events reported with the use of gabapentin in combination with other antiepileptic drugs in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age, not seen at an equal frequency among placebo-treated patients, were viral infection, fever, nausea and\/or vomiting, somnolence, and hostility (see WARNINGS , Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events ). Approximately 7% of the 2074 patients > 12 years of age and approximately 7% of the 449 pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age who received gabapentin in premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in patients > 12 years of age were somnolence (1.2%), ataxia (0.8%), fatigue (0.6%), nausea and\/or vomiting (0.6%), and dizziness (0.6%). The adverse events most commonly associated with withdrawal in pediatric patients were emotional lability (1.6%), hostility (1.3%), and hyperkinesia (1.1%). Incidence in Controlled Clinical Trials Table 4 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 1% of gabapentin -treated patients > 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. In these studies, either gabapentin or placebo was added to the patient's current antiepileptic drug therapy. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. The prescriber should be aware that these figures, obtained when gabapentin was added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, cannot be used to predict the frequency of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors may differ from those prevailing during clinical studies. Similarly, the cited frequencies cannot be directly compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments, uses, or investigators. An inspection of these frequencies, however, does provide the prescribing physician with one basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the adverse event incidences in the population studied. TABLE 4.

Among the treatment-emergent adverse events occurring at an incidence of at least 10% of gabapentin-treated patients, somnolence and ataxia appeared to exhibit a positive dose-response relationship. The overall incidence of adverse events and the types of adverse events seen were similar among men and women treated with gabapentin. The incidence of adverse events increased slightly with increasing age in patients treated with either gabapentin or placebo. Because only 3% of patients (28\/921) in placebo-controlled studies were identified as nonwhite (black or other), there are insufficient data to support a statement regarding the distribution of adverse events by race. Table 5 lists treatment-emergent signs and symptoms that occurred in at least 2% of gabapentin -treated patients age 3 to 12 years of age with epilepsy participating in placebo-controlled trials and were numerically more common in the gabapentin group. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in intensity. TABLE 5.

Other Adverse Events Observed During All Clinical Trials Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents (Except Clinical Trials in Neuropathic Pain) Gabapentin has been administered to 4717 patients > 12 years of age during all adjunctive therapy clinical trials (except clinical trials in patients with neuropathic pain), only some of which were placebo-controlled. During these trials, all adverse events were recorded by the clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing. To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals having adverse events, similar types of events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized categories using modified COSTART dictionary terminology. These categories are used in the listing below. The frequencies presented represent the proportion of the 4717 patients > 12 years of age exposed to gabapentin who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving gabapentin. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 4 , those too general to be informative, and those not reasonably associated with the use of the drug. Events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions: frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1\/100 patients; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1\/100 to 1\/1000 patients; rare events are those occurring in fewer than 1\/1000 patients.
