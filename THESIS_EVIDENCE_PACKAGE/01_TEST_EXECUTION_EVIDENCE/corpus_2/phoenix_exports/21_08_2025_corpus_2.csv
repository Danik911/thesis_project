- URS-023-002: Generate pull lists and chain-of-custody forms from configured templates.
- URS-023-003: Enforce method-version control for stability tests.
- URS-023-004: Provide configured CoA report with vendor reporting engine.
- URS-023-005: Manage excursions with configured impact assessment workflow.
- URS-023-006: Provide inventory tracking for stability samples.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-023-007: Maintain ALCOA+ audit trail and electronic signatures.
- URS-023-008: Ensure traceability from protocol to results and final report.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-023-009: Support 10,000 active samples across 8 chambers.
- URS-023-010: Generate pull list for 500 samples in < 5 seconds.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-023-011: Integrate with LIMS and WMS via standard APIs.
- URS-023-012: Receive chamber conditions from EMS via interface.

- URS-023-004: Provide configured CoA report with vendor reporting engine.
- URS-023-005: Manage excursions with configured impact assessment workflow.
- URS-023-006: Provide inventory tracking for stability samples.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-023-007: Maintain ALCOA+ audit trail and electronic signatures.
- URS-023-008: Ensure traceability from protocol to results and final report.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-023-009: Support 10,000 active samples across 8 chambers.
- URS-023-010: Generate pull list for 500 samples in < 5 seconds.

## 5. Integration Requirements

URS CONTENT: # URS-025: Custom Batch Release Orchestrator
**GAMP Category**: (Custom Application)
**System Type**: Microservice-based orchestrator with proprietary release rules
**Domain**: Manufacturing Operations
**Complexity Level**: High

## 1. Introduction
Develop a custom application that orchestrates batch release by applying proprietary algorithms combining QC results, deviations, and stability trending.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- URS-025-001: Ingest test results, deviations, and stability metrics via APIs.
- URS-025-002: Apply proprietary multi-factor release scoring algorithm.
- URS-025-003: Provide explainability dashboard for each release decision.
- URS-025-004: Support manual override with dual e-signature and rationale.
- URS-025-005: Generate release packet with all evidentiary documents.
- URS-025-006: Implement rule versioning with rollback capability.
- URS-025-007: Provide sandbox for what-if analysis on release rules.

## 3. Regulatory Requirements
- URS-025-008: Maintain data lineage and ALCOA+ attributes for all inputs.
- URS-025-009: Enforce 21 CFR Part 11 for approvals.
- URS-025-010: Provide traceability from algorithm input to final disposition.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- URS-025-011: Process a batch decision in < 5 seconds with 1,000 inputs.
- URS-025-012: Availability ≥ 99.9% with active-active deployment.

## 5. Integration Requirements
- URS-025-013: Integrations with LIMS, QMS, MES, and ERP via APIs.
- URS-025-014: SSO via OIDC with role-based authorization.

## 6. Technical Architecture Requirements
- URS-025-015: Microservices with message bus (e.g., Kafka) and event sourcing.
- URS-025-016: Immutable audit store with append-only log.
- URS-025-017: Blue/green deployment strategy with automated rollback.
