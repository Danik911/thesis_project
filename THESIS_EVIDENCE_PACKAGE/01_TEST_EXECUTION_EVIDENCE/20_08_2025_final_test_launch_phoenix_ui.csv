  - Dynamic in-process control limits based on multivariate analysis
  - Real-time batch genealogy tracking across multiple unit operations
  - Proprietary yield optimization calculations
- **URS-MES-003**: Develop custom interfaces for:
  - 12 different equipment types with proprietary protocols
  - Integration with custom warehouse management system
  - Real-time data exchange with proprietary PAT systems
- **URS-MES-004**: Custom workflow engine to handle:
  - Parallel processing paths unique to our manufacturing process
  - Complex exception handling for deviations
  - Site-specific business rules not supported by commercial packages

This URS defines requirements for a CDS to control HPLC/GC instruments and process chromatographic data.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **URS-CDS-001**: System based on commercial CDS software (Empower/OpenLab).
- **URS-CDS-002**: Use vendor's standard instrument control for Waters/Agilent equipment.
- **URS-CDS-003**: Minor configuration of acquisition methods within vendor parameters.
- **URS-CDS-004**: Implement custom calculations using vendor's formula editor:
  - Non-standard impurity calculations
  - Proprietary relative response factor adjustments
  - Complex bracketing schemes beyond vendor defaults
- **URS-CDS-005**: Develop custom reports using vendor's report designer.
- **URS-CDS-006**: Configure standard integration parameters for peak detection.
- **URS-CDS-007**: Create custom export routines for LIMS interface.
- **URS-CDS-008**: Implement site-specific naming conventions via configuration.

## 3. Ambiguous Requirements
- **URS-CDS-009**: System shall support ""enhanced"" system suitability calculations (Note: unclear if vendor's standard SST is sufficient or custom development needed).
- **URS-CDS-010**: Implement ""advanced"" trending capabilities for method performance.
- **URS-CDS-011**: System shall handle ""complex"" multi-dimensional chromatography.

## 4. Performance Requirements
- **URS-CDS-012**: Data acquisition shall support up to 8 simultaneous instrument runs.
- **URS-CDS-013**: Peak integration processing shall complete within 30 seconds.
- **URS-CDS-014**: Custom calculation routines shall execute within 60 seconds.

## 5. Regulatory Requirements
- **URS-CDS-015**: System shall maintain complete audit trail for all analytical data per 21 CFR Part 11.
- **URS-CDS-016**: Electronic signatures shall be implemented for method approval and data review.
- **URS-CDS-017**: Data integrity controls shall prevent unauthorized data modification.
- **URS-CDS-018**: System shall support data retention requirements for regulatory submissions.

## 6. Integration Requirements
- **URS-CDS-019**: Interface with LIMS using standard XML format.
- **URS-CDS-020**: Export data to regulatory submission formats (eCTD).
- **URS-CDS-021**: Synchronize with enterprise document management system.

- **URS-CDS-010**: Implement ""advanced"" trending capabilities for method performance.
- **URS-CDS-011**: System shall handle ""complex"" multi-dimensional chromatography.

## 4. Performance Requirements

- **URS-CDS-014**: Custom calculation routines shall execute within 60 seconds.

## 5. Regulatory Requirements
- **URS-CDS-015**: System shall maintain complete audit trail for all analytical data per 21 CFR Part 11.
- **URS-CDS-016**: Electronic signatures shall be implemented for method approval and data review.
- **URS-CDS-017**: Data integrity controls shall prevent unauthorized data modification.
- **URS-CDS-018**: System shall support data retention requirements for regulatory submissions.

## 6. Integration Requirements
- **URS-CDS-019**: Interface with LIMS using standard XML format.
- **URS-CDS-020**: Export data to regulatory submission formats (eCTD).
- **URS-CDS-021**: Synchronize with enterprise document management system.
