- $150/hour expert rate = $5,100

Automated Process:
- 64 minutes total + 2 hours review = 3 hours
- Cost: $0.215 API + $450 review = $450.22

ROI = ($5,100 - $450.22) / $450.22 = 1,033%

## 9. Statistical Significance & Validity

### 9.1 Sample Size Analysis

```python
Required sample size for 95% confidence, 10% margin:
n = Z²×p×(1-p)/E² = 1.96²×0.647×0.353/0.1² = 88 documents

Current sample: 17 documents
Statistical Power: 0.42 (low)
Recommendation: Expand to 100+ documents for thesis validity
```

### 9.2 Hypothesis Testing

**H₀: System achieves ≥80% categorization accuracy**
- Test Statistic: z = 0.41
- p-value: 0.341
- Result: Fail to reject H₀ (insufficient evidence)

**H₀: No significant difference between category success rates**
- Chi-square: χ² = 8.41, df = 2
- p-value: 0.015
- Result: Reject H₀ (significant difference exists)

### 9.3 Limitations

1. **Sample Size**: 17 documents insufficient for robust conclusions
2. **Selection Bias**: Corpus may not represent full document variety
3. **Temporal Factors**: Single execution window
4. **Recovery Bias**: Failed documents not fully analyzed

## 11. Conclusion

### 11.1 Overall Assessment

The Corpus 1 analysis demonstrates that the pharmaceutical multi-agent test generation system achieves **viable but improvable** performance with a 64.7% success rate and 81.8% categorization accuracy. The system shows particular strength in Category 3 (standard) documents with 100% success rate, while struggling with Category 4 (configured) and ambiguous documents.

### 11.2 Thesis Validation

**Strengths Supporting Thesis**:
- Substantial cost reduction (91% vs GPT-4)
- Consistent test generation (6 tests/document)
- Strong GAMP-5 compliance (95%)
- Good inter-rater agreement (κ=0.728)

**Weaknesses Requiring Address**:
- 35.3% failure rate undermines reliability claims
- Limited sample size affects statistical validity
- Missing external integrations reduce capability
- Poor recovery performance (25% success)

### 11.3 Statistical Verdict

With 95% confidence, we can state:
- Success rate is between 41.2% and 88.2%
- Categorization accuracy is between 54.5% and 100%
- System shows promise but requires improvements for production readiness

### 11.4 Final Recommendation

**For Thesis Defense**: The system demonstrates **proof of concept** with clear value proposition but requires addressing the identified critical issues before claiming production readiness. The 64.7% success rate, while not ideal, provides sufficient evidence of viability when combined with the significant cost savings and compliance benefits.

**Evidence Quality Score**: 7.5/10
- Sufficient for academic validation
- Requires expansion for commercial claims
- Strong foundation for future development
