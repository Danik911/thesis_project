## System Description
This is a standard commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) temperature monitoring system for pharmaceutical storage areas. The system uses vendor-supplied software without any customization or configuration beyond standard installation parameters.

## Key Features
- Standard temperature sensors with pre-configured ranges
- Vendor-supplied monitoring software used as-is
- Pre-built reporting templates from vendor
- Standard alert thresholds (no custom business logic)
- Out-of-the-box compliance features

## Requirements
1. Monitor temperature in cold storage units
2. Record readings every 5 minutes
3. Generate standard compliance reports
4. Send email alerts for out-of-range conditions
5. Maintain electronic records per 21 CFR Part 11

## GAMP Category Justification
This system clearly falls under GAMP Category 3 as it is:
- Commercial off-the-shelf software
- No customization or custom code
- Standard configuration only
- Uses vendor's standard functionality
- No bespoke interfaces or modifications"""
